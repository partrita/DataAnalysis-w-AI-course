    "text": "What’s this\nThis course will equip students, who are already versed in core data analysis methods, with experience to harness AI technologies to improve productivity (yes this is classic LLM sentence). But, yeah, the idea is to help students who studied data analysis / econometrics / quant methods and want to think about how to include AI in their analytics routine, and spend time to share experiences.\nAs AI becomes more and more powerful, it is also important to provide a platform to discuss human agency in data analysis. So a key element of the course and its instructor to lead discussions on the role of AI and humans in various aspects of data analysis.\nThis is the 2025 Spring edition release\n\nFor whom?\nThis material is aimed at data science and analytics instructors who can guide their students through the material sharing the experience and domain specific examples. All of this is open source, may be modified (see rights below).\nBut, dear reader (students, practitioners, researchers, journalists and more), you can also go alone, checking ideas and practice sessions.\n\n\nAI and me\nAt the end of all classes, instructors and students should always consider these three questions.\n\nHow did AI support me do what I planned.\nHow did AI fail me: gave half-truths, buggy code, imprecise arguments\nHow did AI extend me: helped do things I could not, or gave new ideas"

    "text": "Course description\n\nContent\nThe course focuses on using large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude.ai, Mistral’s Le Chat, and Google’s Gemini) to carry out tasks in data analysis. It includes topics like data extraction and wrangling, data exploration and descriptive statistics, and creating reports as well as turning text to data.\nThere are three case studies that we use (1) a simulated set of data tables on hotels in Austria, (2) The World Value Survey, and (3) A series of interview textst.\nThe course material includes weekly practice assignments. It also has a learning more collection – to see what is beyond core material with blogs, papers, and video recommendations.\n\n\nBackground: data analysis / econometrics\nYou need a background in Data Analysis / Econometrics, a good introductory course is enough. I, of course, suggest Chapters 1-12 and 19 of Data Analysis for Business, Economics and Policy (Cambridge UP, 2021). Full slideshows, data and code are open source. But consider buying the book!🤝\nIn particular, the course builds on Chapters 1-6 and 7-10, and 19 of Data Analysis but other Introductory Econometrics + basics of data science knowledge is ok.\n\n\nBackground: coding\nStudents are expected to have some basic coding knowledge in Python or R (Stata also fine mostly).\n\n\nRelevance\nAI is everywhere and has become essential, most analytic work will be using it. It’s like the Internet a while back. Does not solve all problems, but almost all intellectual tasks will rely on inputs from it.\n\n\nLearning Outcomes\nKey outcomes. By the end of the course, students will be able to\n\nGain experience and confidence using genAI to carry out key tasks in data analysis.\nBuild AI in coding practice including data wrangling, description and reporting and text analysis\nHave some idea of use cases when AI assistance is (1) greatly useful, (2) helpful, (3) currently problematic.\nHave some idea of use cases when AI assistance is OK to use as is vs needs strong human supervision\nHave an understanding of resources to follow for updates.\n\n\n\nTarget audience\nThis is a course aimed at 3rd (2nd?) year BA and MA students in any program with required background. Economics, Quantitative Social science, Political Science, Sociology, History. To be frank, all students shall learn data analysis and be comfortable using AI.\nBut, anyone can use it with adequate background.\n\n\nCourse Context & Trajectory\nWhat’s Coming Next:\n\nWeek 0: Using AI for Coding – this may not be part of the curriculum\nWeek 1: LLM Review and short task to recrate a graph\nWeek 2: Use AI to understand and document the World Values Survey dataset\nWeek 3: AI-assisted report writing with WVS data\nWeek 4: Multi-table joins with Austrian hotel data\nWeeks 5-6: Text analysis of football manager interviews\nWeek 7: Developing dashboards\nWeek 7: AI as applied metrics consultant\n\nSkills Development Arc:\n\nWeeks 0:  Background prep: Writing code with AI\nWeeks 1-2: Foundation (AI concepts, data exploration)\nWeeks 3-4: Core analysis (reporting, data wrangling)\n\nWeeks 5-6: Advanced applications (text analysis, APIs)\nWeeks 5-6: Helping research and presentation\n\nAssignments\nAssignments are available for all classes\nImportant to note for assignments: * Use AI but do not submit something that was created by AI. AI is your assistant. * One of the goals of the course is to practice this."

    "section": "What is an API?",
    "text": "What is an API?\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is like a messenger or middleman that lets two different programs talk to each other and exchange information. Instead of a person directly doing a task, you have one software program asking another program to do something on its behalf. A popular analogy is that an API is similar to a restaurant waiter:\n\nYou (the client) are sitting at a table, ready to order a meal (you have a request for information or a service).\nThe waiter (the API) takes your order and relays it to the kitchen. You don’t go into the kitchen yourself – the waiter is the go-between.\nThe kitchen (the server) is where the work happens. The chef prepares the meal (the data or service you requested).\nThe waiter (API) returns with your meal and serves it to you. You get exactly what you ordered, without having to know how the kitchen prepared it.\n\nIn this analogy, the restaurant’s menu is like the API documentation – it lists what you can ask for and how to ask for it. If you request something not on the menu, the waiter (API) will tell you it’s not available (an error). Similarly, an API provides a set of rules and endpoints that define what requests can be made and what responses you can expect.\nThis means you don’t need to know the complex inner workings of the server or service. You just need to know what to ask for and how to ask for it through the API. The API handles the communication, just as the waiter handles communication between you and the kitchen."

    "section": "Benefits of Using APIs in Data Analysis",
    "text": "Benefits of Using APIs in Data Analysis\nWhy use APIs as a data analyst? Here are some key benefits:\n\nScalability: APIs let you process large volumes of data quickly. You can automate requests in code, so analyzing 10,000 texts or more becomes feasible. Instead of manually working with each piece of data, you let a server handle the heavy lifting.\nAccess to Powerful Tools: Many companies provide APIs for advanced services like sentiment analysis, language translation, image recognition, or data storage. As a data analyst, you can tap into these pre-built models and services without having to develop them from scratch.\nTime and Effort Savings: Using an API, you can perform complex tasks with just a simple request. This saves you the time of writing extensive code or doing repetitive work. For example, rather than writing your own sentiment analysis algorithm, you can send text to an API and get sentiment results immediately.\nIntegration of Data Sources: APIs allow different software and datasets to integrate. You can pull data from different sources (e.g. Twitter’s API for tweets, a weather API for climate data) directly into your analysis pipeline. This marries data from multiple sources seamlessly.\nConsistency and Reliability: When you use a well-established API, you benefit from a service that’s been tested and optimized. The API will handle errors, edge cases, and updates, so you get consistent results. It’s like outsourcing a task to an expert – you trust the API to do its job correctly."

    "section": "API Keys and Authentication",
    "text": "API Keys and Authentication\nMost APIs require some form of authentication to ensure that only authorized users or applications can use them. The simplest form is an API key. An API key is like a secret password or ID that you include with your API calls:\n\nYou typically get an API key by creating an account or registering an application with the API provider. For example, to use the Twitter API or OpenAI API, you’d sign up and receive a key (or token).\nThe key itself is usually a long string of characters (letters, numbers, and symbols). It’s unique to you or your application.\nYou include this key with every request. Often it goes in a request header (for instance, you might set a header Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY), or sometimes as a URL parameter (e.g., ?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY in the query string). The API documentation will tell you exactly how to include the key.\nThe server checks the key. If the key is missing or wrong, the API will usually respond with an authentication error (like a 401 Unauthorized status). If the key is valid, the server will proceed to handle your request.\nSecurity tip: Never share your API keys publicly or commit them to public repositories. They are meant to be kept secret. If someone obtains your key, they could use the API pretending to be you, which might violate usage limits or incur costs on your account.\n\nSome services use more complex authentication (like OAuth tokens which have limited scope or expiration), but an API key is the fundamental concept to understand first. It’s your access credential for using the API."

In R, for example, packages like httr (for making HTTP requests) and jsonlite (for parsing JSON) are commonly used to work with web APIs. Many APIs also have R packages or wrappers that function like client libraries, letting you call the API in one or two lines of R code. The core idea is the same: a client library abstracts the RESTful requests into native language functions. Regardless of language, using a client library means you can integrate an API into your data analysis or application with less hassle, letting you focus on interpreting results rather than the mechanics of HTTP."

You could get results in minutes or hours rather than weeks.\nYou can harness powerful algorithms provided by industry leaders. For example, instead of developing your machine learning model, you can use Google’s vision API to tag images or OpenAI’s language API to summarize text. This means you can tackle complex problems without needing to be an expert in those specific subfields.\nYou can work with real-time and large-scale data. Want to analyze football statistics or financial market data? There are APIs to fetch those streams of information. With APIs, you are not limited to data you can collect manually; you can pull in data from all over the world programmatically.\n\nAPIs are a bridge to practically unlimited data and capabilities. They let your programs communicate with other services to get things done efficiently. As we continue this course, you’ll get hands-on experience using APIs – turning the concepts you learned here into actual data analysis tasks. Embrace this new tool in your skillset. Whenever you find yourself needing to scale up or access a specialized service, think: Is there an API for that? Chances are, the answer will be yes, and now you’ll know how to use it!\nMore advanced and supplementary information."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Before diving into APIs, it’s essential to understand how web communication works at its most basic level. The web runs on HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), a simple, text-based language that lets one computer or application (the client) ask another computer (the server) for data or actions. Whenever you browse a site or call a web service, your client sends an HTTP request and the server answers with an HTTP response.\nAn HTTP request consists of a URL—the address of the resource or endpoint you want—and an HTTP method, which tells the server what you’d like to do. The two most common methods are GET (to fetch data, like loading a webpage) and POST (to submit data, such as filling in a form).

    "text": "Before diving into APIs, it’s essential to understand how web communication works at its most basic level. The web runs on HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), a simple, text-based language that lets one computer or application (the client) ask another computer (the server) for data or actions. Whenever you browse a site or call a web service, your client sends an HTTP request and the server answers with an HTTP response.\nAn HTTP request consists of a URL—the address of the resource or endpoint you want—and an HTTP method, which tells the server what you’d like to do. The two most common methods are GET (to fetch data, like loading a webpage) and POST (to submit data, such as filling in a form). By combining the URL and method (e.g. GET https://example.com/data), the client makes its intentions clear.\nWhen the server receives that request, it processes whatever work is needed—retrieving files, querying a database, or running a service—and then sends back a response.

    "section": "How APIs Work: Client-Server Interaction, Requests, and Responses",
    "text": "How APIs Work: Client-Server Interaction, Requests, and Responses\nAt its core, an API works through a client-server interaction over the internet. Let’s break down the key concepts:\n\nClient and Server: The client is the part that sends a request (this would be your code or application), and the server is the part that receives the request and provides a response (this is the API’s service, often running on a remote server or in the cloud). In our context, you (or your Python script) are the client, and the API provider’s system is the server.\nRequest: A request is the message the client sends to the server asking for some action or data. Think of it as filling out an order form or making a specific query. A request typically includes:\n\nAn endpoint URL (the address of the API and the specific service you want).\nA method/verb (often one of the HTTP methods like GET to retrieve data or POST to send data).\nParameters or data (any additional information the server needs, such as the text you want analyzed or a query like a city name for a weather API).\nHeaders including an API key if required (more on API keys soon).\n\nResponse: After the server receives your request and processes it, it sends back a response. The response contains:\n\nStatus code – a number that tells you if the request was successful (e.g. 200 OK), or if something went wrong (e.g. 404 Not Found, 401 Unauthorized).\nData – the information you asked for, often in a structured format like JSON (a common text-based data format) or XML. For example, if you requested sentiment analysis, the response data might be a sentiment score or label for your text.\nMetadata or messages – sometimes additional info, like how long the request took or usage details.\n\n\n Client-Server Communication: Your application (client) sends an HTTP request to an API’s server (for example, asking for sentiment analysis on some text). The server then processes that request and sends back an HTTP response containing the result (for instance, the sentiment score). This request-response cycle is the foundation of how we use APIs.\n\nAPI Endpoint: An endpoint is a specific address (URL) that you hit to access a particular service or data from an API. It’s like a function or feature on the server that you can invoke. For example, a sentiment analysis API might have an endpoint like /analyzeSentiment that you call to get a sentiment result. Each endpoint usually corresponds to one type of task or data.\nAPI Documentation: Because you can’t see the “kitchen” (the server’s internal code or database), the API documentation is your guide to what you can request and how to format those requests. It typically lists all available endpoints, what parameters they accept, what kind of output they return, and examples. Good documentation is like a user manual for the API."

    "section": "REST APIs: The Common Way to Communicate",
    "text": "REST APIs: The Common Way to Communicate\nWhen people talk about web APIs, they are often referring to REST APIs. REST stands for Representational State Transfer, which is a style of designing networked applications. You don’t need to remember the term, but here’s what it means in practice:\n\nUses HTTP: REST APIs use the same protocol your web browser uses – HTTP. This means you’re often calling URLs (web addresses) just like loading a webpage, but instead of a webpage, you get data.\nEndpoints and Resources: In a REST API, different URLs (endpoints) represent different resources or services. For example, GET https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London might retrieve weather data for London. Here, the endpoint /data/2.5/weather is a resource for weather info, and q=London is a parameter specifying the city.\nHTTP Methods (Verbs): REST APIs make use of HTTP methods such as:\n\nGET – Retrieve data (for example, get information or fetch results; e.g., get the sentiment of a text or fetch a list of comments).\nPOST – Send data or create a new resource (for example, submit a new text to be analyzed, or add a new entry to a database via the API).\nPUT/PATCH – Update an existing resource (for example, update a record in a database).\nDELETE – Delete a resource.\n\nIn our sentiment analysis example, you might use a GET request if the text is included in the URL or a POST request if you are sending the text in the request body. The key idea is that the method indicates what action you want to perform on the resource.\nStateless Communication: REST APIs are stateless, meaning each request is independent. The server doesn’t retain information about your previous requests. This is like each request being a separate, self-contained transaction. For instance, if you call the sentiment analysis API twice with two different texts, the server doesn’t remember the first text when processing the second – you need to send all the information it needs each time. The stateless design makes it easier to scale and ensures that each server can handle any request without needing to know what came before.\n\nREST APIs are popular because they are simple, scalable, and use existing web standards. Almost any programming environment can send HTTP requests, so REST makes it easy to interact with services from different languages and platforms. When you hear about APIs from providers like Google, Twitter, or OpenAI, they are usually implemented as RESTful APIs."

    "section": "Other API Styles: GraphQL and WebSockets",
    "text": "Other API Styles: GraphQL and WebSockets\nREST is the most common approach, but it’s not the only pattern you might encounter. Here are two other API styles, just for your awareness:\n\nGraphQL: GraphQL is an alternative approach where instead of multiple specific endpoints, you have a single endpoint that can handle flexible queries. You send a query describing exactly what data you want, and you get back precisely that data. This can reduce the number of requests needed for complex apps. For example, if a REST API required you to call one endpoint for user info and another for user posts, a GraphQL API could allow you to get both in a single request by specifying that in the query. It’s powerful for complex data fetching, but also a bit more advanced in usage. (In this course we won’t be using GraphQL, but it’s good to know it exists.)\nWebSockets (Real-Time APIs): A WebSocket provides a continuous two-way connection between client and server, allowing data to be sent in real time. This isn’t a request-response model; it’s more like an open channel. WebSockets are useful for applications like live chat, streaming data updates, or multiplayer games – anywhere you want instant, ongoing data flow. For instance, if you were tracking sentiment on a live stream of tweets, a WebSocket connection could stream new analyses continuously. This is more specialized, so we’ll stick to the request/response style in our work, but you might encounter WebSocket APIs in other contexts (e.g., real-time stock price feeds).\n\nFor most data analysis tasks (like fetching data or sending data for analysis), you’ll be using REST APIs, as they cover the majority of use cases and are easier to get started with.\nGreat, I’ll put together a conceptual overview of how API client libraries (especially in Python, with a mention of R) work, including when and why you’d use them, and how they simplify HTTP requests behind the scenes. I’ll be back shortly with the draft section you can add to your markdown."

    "title": "Supplementary Information for Introduction to APIs",
    "section": "API Client Libraries",
    "text": "API Client Libraries\nWhen working with web APIs, you often have the choice of using API client libraries instead of crafting raw HTTP requests. An API client library (sometimes called an SDK or helper library) is a package provided in a specific programming language that wraps the API’s functionality in convenient functions or classes. In Python especially, many major services offer official or community-maintained libraries to simplify API usage. These libraries act as a language-specific abstraction layer over the API – they break the API’s usual language-agnostic nature to make the developer experience smoother. In practice, this means you can interact with the API using Python objects and methods, rather than manually formatting HTTP requests and parsing responses.\nWhy use a client library? Client libraries simplify and reduce the code you need to write for common API tasks. Instead of manually assembling URLs, query parameters, headers, and JSON payloads for each request, you can call a function or method provided by the library and let it handle those details. For example, a library might provide a method like get_user_tweets(\"Alice\") or openai.ChatCompletion.create(...) – behind the scenes, that method will construct the proper HTTP request (with the correct endpoint and parameters), send it, and parse the result for you. In other words, the library “abstracts away the HTTP requests and offers more convenient interfaces” to work with the API. This abstraction typically covers:\n\nRequest formatting and transport: The library builds the correct HTTP requests (URLs, methods, headers, body) and sends them using an HTTP client, so you don’t have to manually use tools like requests or curl. It also often manages details like authentication headers (API keys, tokens) for you after an initial setup.\nResponse parsing and serialization: Data returned from the API (usually in JSON) is automatically parsed into Python data structures or objects. Similarly, when you provide data to send (like a dictionary or object), the library serializes it to JSON. This spares you from manual JSON formatting.\nError handling and reliability: Good client libraries include error handling logic. They might raise clear exceptions for error responses (rather than you checking HTTP status codes yourself) and handle common issues like rate limiting or retries. This means your code can focus on what you want to do with the API, and the library handles the low-level communication details.\nIdiomatic interface: The library’s functions and classes are designed to feel natural in the given language. For instance, Python libraries will return Python objects (like dictionaries or custom classes) and use Python naming conventions. This makes the API “simple and intuitive to use” in that language, as opposed to treating everything as raw text or HTTP mechanics."

    "section": "Making an API Call: A Conceptual Walkthrough",
    "text": "Making an API Call: A Conceptual Walkthrough\nLet’s put all this into a concrete example without diving into code. How would you use an API for a task, say, analyzing sentiment on a large number of texts? Here’s the high-level process:\n\nFind a Suitable API & Read the Documentation: First, you’d identify an API that offers sentiment analysis (or whatever task you need). This could be a cloud service like Azure Cognitive Services, IBM Watson NLU, or OpenAI’s API. You’d read the documentation to find out the endpoint for sentiment analysis, what inputs it expects (maybe it requires a piece of text or a list of texts, and possibly a language or other settings), and what the output looks like.\nObtain Access (API Key): You sign up for the service to get your API key (or other credentials). For example, you might create a free account and receive a key like abcd1234... that identifies you.\nConstruct the Request: Using the information from the docs, you prepare your API request. For example:\n\nDecide on the HTTP method: sentiment analysis might require a POST request because you’re sending data (the text).\nDetermine the endpoint URL: e.g., https://api.some-service.com/v1/sentiment.\nPrepare the data format: the API might require JSON. For instance, you might need to send {\"text\": \"I love this product!\"} in the body of the request. If you have multiple texts, maybe it allows an array of texts.\nInclude your API key as instructed (maybe in a header or as a parameter).\n\nSend the Request (Client side): Now you send the request from your client (which could be a Python script, a command-line tool like curl, or an app like Postman for testing). This is when your program reaches out over the internet to the API’s server with your request details.\nReceive the Response (Server side): The API’s server processes your input. It runs the sentiment analysis on the text you sent. Then it sends back a response. Let’s say the response is a JSON object like: {\"sentiment\": \"positive\", \"confidence\": 0.95}, along with an HTTP status code 200 (meaning success). If something was wrong (e.g., missing the API key or the text was too long), you might get an error response instead of explaining what went wrong.\nIntegrate the Results: Your code receives this response data. Now you can use it in your analysis. For instance, your program can take the \"sentiment\": \"positive\" value and record that this particular review was positive. You might loop through all 10,000 reviews, call the API for each, and collect the results. In the end, you could calculate statistics (like 60% of reviews are positive, 30% neutral, 10% negative, etc.) or visualize the data.\n\nThroughout this process, the heavy work (the actual sentiment computation) is done by the API provider’s servers. Your job is to correctly send requests and process the responses. In practice, you’d likely write a small script to automate steps 3–6 so that you can handle many texts sequentially or in parallel.\nEven without writing code here, hopefully, you can see the pattern: find API -&gt; get access -&gt; request -&gt; response -&gt; use data. Once you learn to do this, you can apply it to countless situations, not just sentiment analysis.\nPlease see our api-use.md file for fundamental information."

    "text": "What’s different in R\nClient libraries in other languages: While our focus is on Python, other programming languages provide similar conveniences.\nIn R, packages like httr (for making HTTP requests) and jsonlite (for parsing JSON) are commonly used to work with web APIs. Many APIs also have R packages or wrappers that function like client libraries, letting you call the API in one or two lines of R code.\nThe core idea is the same: a client library abstracts the RESTful requests into native language functions. Regardless of language, using a client library means you can integrate an API into your data analysis or application with less hassle, letting you focus on interpreting results rather than the mechanics of HTTP."

Two extremes.\n\nDescribe age. In a graph. (Hint: think about binsize)\nCreate an interesting and well-done scatterplot (turn o3 on or use Claude Sonnet)"
