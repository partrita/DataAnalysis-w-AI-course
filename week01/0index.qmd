**The Financial Times Challenge**

Take a look at this excellent [Financial Times visualization](assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) showing market reactions to Trump's tariff announcements.

**Your Mission:**

Using AI assistance, reproduce this chart as accurately as possible, in the shortest time.

**Learning Goals:**

- Experience AI-assisted data visualization
- Practice prompt engineering for a specific task
- Understand the balance between human direction and AI execution, the dangers of relying too much on AI

## Preparation

::: {.callout-tip icon="üí°"}
## Before Class

- No specific preparation is needed for Week 1.
- Come ready to discuss your current experience with AI tools.
- Bring examples of AI encounters in your work/studies.
:::

## Discussion Questions

As you engage with the material, consider these questions:

1.  **Personal AI Experience:** How have you already integrated AI into your daily life? Which models feel most natural to you?

2.  **Error Management:** How do you currently deal with AI hallucinations or incomplete answers?

3.  **Jagged Frontier:** For which tasks do you anticipate AI will excel? Where do you think it will struggle?

## Tools and Resources

**Recommended AI Platforms for this course:**

- **ChatGPT 4o/o1** - Excellent for coding and data analysis
- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** - Strong for research and writing tasks
- **GitHub Copilot** - For integrated coding assistance

**Getting Started:**

- Most tasks can be done with free tiers.
- Consider paid subscriptions for intensive work (typically $20/month).
- See the [AI Model Comparison Guide](assets/which-ai.html) for detailed recommendations.

## Week 1 Outcomes

Upon completing Week 1, you should be able to:

- ‚úÖ Understand what tasks LLMs can and cannot reliably perform.
- ‚úÖ Have hands-on experience with AI-assisted data visualization.
- ‚úÖ Appreciate the importance of human oversight in AI workflows.
- ‚úÖ Be prepared to use AI as a collaborative tool throughout the course.

## Note on Academic Integrity

This course teaches you to use AI as a powerful assistant while maintaining your responsibility as an analyst and author. Always verify AI output, cite your methods, and understand the analysis you present.
