## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will be able to:

- Understand the core concepts and architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs).
- Learn how to effectively integrate AI into their data analysis workflow.
- Distinguish between "cyborg" and "centaur" approaches to AI collaboration.
- Experience the "jagged frontier" of LLM capabilities through hands-on practice.
- Critically evaluate the capabilities and limitations of AI tools in an academic context.
- Develop foundational prompt engineering skills for data analysis tasks.

## Preparation / Before Class

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
üìö **No Required Readings**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**It's Week 1** - come ready to explore and discuss!

**Prepare for Reflection:**

- Think about your current experience with AI tools (if any).
- Consider examples of AI encounters in your work/studies.
- Identify one data analysis task you find time-consuming or repetitive.

**Optional Background:**

- Ethan Mollick: "Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI" (Chapters 1-2)

::: {.card-body}
**[Slideshow: LLM Concepts and Applications](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/courses/da-w-ai-2025/da-w-ai-01-llm-course.html)**

**Key topics covered:**

- **What are LLMs?** Statistical models predicting next tokens from vast training data
- **The Transformer Revolution:** How "Attention is All You Need" (2017) changed everything
- **Context Windows:** Why this matters for data analysis
- **The Learning Process:** Resources and human feedback
- **Collaboration Frameworks:** How to integrate human and AI work

üîß **Hands-on: The FT Graph Challenge (25 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**The Challenge:**

Using AI assistance, reproduce this [Financial Times tariff/yield visualization](assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) as accurately as possible.

- Note the sophisticated design: multiple data series, annotations, professional styling
- Consider: What would it take to recreate this manually vs. with AI assistance?

**Learning Approach:**

- Original analysis - what data sources, what design elements?
- Use AI to find data and generate initial code
- Iterate and refine based on results

## Discussion Questions

**Weekend Reflection:**

1.  **Personal AI Experience:** How have you already integrated AI into your daily life? Which models feel most natural to you?

2.  **Error Management:** How do you currently deal with AI hallucinations or incomplete answers? What strategies emerged during the FT graph exercise?

3.  **Jagged Frontier:** For which tasks do you anticipate AI will excel? Where do you think it will struggle? Did the visualization exercise meet your expectations?

## Assignment

::: {.callout-note icon="üìù"}
## Assignment 1: Reproduce FT graph

**Due:** Before Week 2

**Choose your approach:**

- **Option A (Standard):** Use AI to find data and recreate the visualization with same design principles.
- **Option B (Advanced):** Build an interactive dashboard that updates dynamically.

## Background, tools and resources

ü§ñ **Recommended for Data Analysis:**

| Platform | Strength | Best For | Cost |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| **ChatGPT 4o/o1** | Excellent coding, data analysis tools | R/Python code, statistical methods | $20/month |
| **Claude 4 Sonnet** | Superior reasoning, document analysis | Research, writing, complex prompts | $20/month |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Integrated coding assistance | Real-time code completion | $10/month |

**Free Tier Capabilities:**

- Most course tasks doable with free versions
- Paid subscriptions recommended for intensive work -- you may try one during this course
- Start free, upgrade if you hit limits

### Academic Integrity and AI Use

**Course Philosophy:**

- **Leverage AI as an Assistant:** Use AI to augment your abilities, not replace your thinking.
- **Maintain Authorship:** You are responsible for all deliverables and interpretations.
- **Verify Everything:** Always check AI suggestions, especially statistical claims.
- **Document Usage:** Keep track of how AI assisted you -- useful for methods sections.

**Red Lines:**

- Never submit unverified AI output as your own work.
- Always understand the analysis you present.
- Cite AI assistance appropriately (we'll discuss as standards evolve).

**Goal:**

Become a more capable data analyst who can effectively utilize AI tools while upholding scientific rigor.

**Next week:**

[Week 02 - Finding and Documenting Data](../week02/) we will use AI to understand and document a complex dataset.

## Some personal notes on AI and this class

* I had to rewrite and edit the slideshows every couple of months. Gosh, this course material is tricky. (While [Gosset's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) has been around since 1908...)
* It was AI (Claude Sonnet 4.0) that suggested to include the last bit on academic integrity and wrote much of it, like having red lines. LOL.
