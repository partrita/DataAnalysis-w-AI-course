## Learning Objectives

By the end of this session, students will:

- Understand core concepts and architecture behind large language models (LLMs)
- Learn how to incorporate AI into data analysis workflows effectively
-  Distinguish between "Cyborg" and "Centaur" approaches to AI collaboration
- Experience the "jagged frontier" of LLM capabilities through hands-on practice
- Critically assess capabilities and limitations of AI tools in academic contexts
-  Develop foundational prompt engineering skills for data analysis tasks

## Preparation / Before Class

::: {.week-card .card}

📚 **No Required Reading**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**This is Week 1** - come ready to explore and discuss!

 **Reflection Preparation:**

- Think about your current experience with AI tools (if any)
- Consider examples where you've encountered AI in your work/studies
-  Identify one data analysis task you find time-consuming or repetitive

**Optional Background:**

- Ethan Mollick: "Co-Intelligence: Living and Working with AI" (Chapters 1-2)

**[Slideshow: LLM Concepts and Applications](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/courses/da-w-ai-2025/da-w-ai-01-llm-course.html)**

**Key Topics Covered:**

- **What are LLMs?** Statistical models predicting next tokens from massive training data
- **The Transformer Revolution:** How 2017's "Attention is All You Need" changed everything
- **Context Windows:** why this matters for data analysis
- **Training Process:** Resources and human feedback
 - **Collaborative Frameworks:** How to integrate human and AI work

🔧 **Hands-on: FT Graph Challenge (25 min)**
:::
::: {.card-body}
**The Challenge:**

Recreate the [Financial Times tariff/yield visualization](assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) as accurately as possible using AI assistance.

- Note the sophisticated design: multiple data series, annotations, professional styling
- Consider: What would you need to recreate this manually vs. with AI assistance?


**Learning Approach:**

- Analyze the original - what data sources, what design elements?
- Use AI to find data and generate initial code
- Iterate and refine based on results

## Discussion Questions

**End of Week Reflection:**

1. **Personal AI Experience:** How have you already incorporated AI into your routine? Which model feels most natural to you?

2. **Error Management:** How do you currently deal with AI hallucinations or imperfect answers?  What strategies emerged during the FT graph exercise?

3. **The Jagged Frontier:** What tasks do you expect AI to excel at? Where do you think it will struggle?  Did the visualization exercise match your expectations?


## Assignment

::: {.callout-note icon="📝"}
## Assignment 1: Reproduce the FT Graph

**Due:** Before Week 2

**Choose your approach:**

- **Option A (Standard):** Use AI to find data and recreate the visualization with same design principles
- **Option B (Advanced):** Build an interactive dashboard that updates dynamically

## Background, Tools and Resources

🤖 **Recommended for Data Analysis:**

| Platform | Strengths | Best For | Cost |
|----------|-----------|----------|------|
| **ChatGPT 4o/o1** | Excellent coding, data analysis tools | R/Python code, statistical methods | $20/month |
| **Claude 4 Sonnet** | Great reasoning, document analysis | Research, writing, complex prompts | $20/month |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Integrated coding assistance | Real-time code completion | $10/month |

**Free Tier Capabilities:**

- Most course tasks achievable with free versions
- Paid subscriptions recommended for intensive work -- maybe try during this course
- Start free, upgrade if you hit limits

### Academic Integrity and AI use

**Course Philosophy:**

- **AI as Assistant:** Use AI to enhance your capabilities, not replace your thinking
- **Maintain Authority:** You remain responsible for all outputs and interpretations
- **Verify Everything:** Always validate AI suggestions, especially statistical claims
- **Document Usage:** Keep track of how AI helped -- useful for methodology sections

**Red Lines:**

- Never submit unverified AI output as your own work
- Always understand the analysis you're presenting
- Cite AI assistance appropriately (we'll discuss standards as they evolve)

**The Goal:** 

Become a more capable data analyst who can leverage AI tools effectively while maintaining scientific rigor.

**Next Week:** 

[Week 2 - Data Discovery and Documentation](../week02/) where we'll use AI to understand and document complex datasets.

## Some personal comments on AI and this class

* I needed to rewrite, edit the slideshow every other month. Bloody hell, this course material is tricky. (While [Gosset's t-test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test) has been around since 1908...)
* It was an AI (Claude Sonnet 4.0) that suggest to include the last bit on Academic Integrity and it wrote many lines such as having red lines. Hahh.
