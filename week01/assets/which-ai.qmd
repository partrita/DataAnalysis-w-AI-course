This is my personal take as of `date:2025-05-22`.

Generative AI based on large language models (genAI) is great for many tasks. In this course we focus on these aspects of data analysis only:

* designing analysis
* writing code
* data cleaning, like joining tables, sample design, variable transformation
* exploratory data analysis
* modelling, regression, machine learning
* causal inference
* creating tables and graphs
* writing reports and presentations


## Various AI providers and their models

### OpenAI ChatGPT

Currently key models are `4o`, `o3`, `4.1`.

Here's an updated, concise guide including **o3**, **o4-mini-high**, **GPT-4.5**, and **Deep Research**:

*Here's a brief guide on when and why to use ChatGPT's models:*

#### üîç **Model Overview**

| **Model**             | **Strengths**                                                              | **When to Use**                                     |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **GPT-4-turbo (4o)** | Fast, accurate, good with long prompts and code.                       | Coding, EDA, modeling, teaching default         |
| **GPT-4.5**          | Slightly better reasoning and math, but not always faster.             | More complex logic, multi-step planning         |
| **GPT-4 (classic)**  | Stable and reliable for structured tasks.                              | When consistent responses are needed (e.g. templates) |
| **o3**               | Small, efficient, creative, but can be vague.                          | Brainstorming, creative prompt design           |
| **o4-mini-high**     | Lightweight, fast, good for quick checks or when resources are limited.  | Instant feedback, code sketching                |
| **Deep Research**    | Accesses full documents, citations, and in-depth factual retrieval.    | Literature reviews, technical deep dives        |


### ‚úÖ **Best Model by Task**

| **Task**                      | **Best Model(s)**           | **Notes**                                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Designing Analysis            | 4o / GPT-4.5                | Handles multi-step reasoning well.                          |
| Writing Code (R, Python, SQL) | 4o / GPT-4.5 / o4-mini-high | Use 4o for heavy tidyverse work, o4-mini for quick drafts   |
| Data Cleaning                 | 4o                          | Very proficient with `dplyr`, `data.table`, `pandas`.       |
| Exploratory Data Analysis     | 4o + Code Interpreter       | Visualization, summaries, and diagnostics                   |
| Modeling (ML, Regression)     | GPT-4.5 / 4o                | Clear, structured models and diagnostics                    |
| Causal Inference              | GPT-4.5 / 4o                | Handles DiD, IV, RDD, matching logic well.                  |
| Creating Tables & Graphs      | 4o / GPT-4.5                | Knows LaTeX, Markdown, ggplot2, matplotlib formatting.      |
| Writing Reports/Slides        | 4o / GPT-4 / o3             | Use 4o for clarity, o3 for more creative text generation    |
| Literature Search/Citations   | **Deep Research**           | Finds, summarizes, and cites academic papers.               |

### Anthropic Claude

Currently key model is Claude Sonnet 3.7

Key tool
* Projects: organize files, allow queries. One example is a whole codebase.

### Others

Many other models, but I have much less experience.

## Free vs Pro?

Current free models are great for many tasks like coding, idea generation.

### ChatGPT

Free version gives GPT‚Äë4.1 mini, access to live data on the web, with search. Also
* limited access to GPT‚Äë4o, OpenAI o4-mini, and Deep Research
* limited access to file uploads, data analysis

[Plus version](https://openai.com/chatgpt/pricing/) gives:

* Access to reasoning models (OpenAI o3, OpenAI o4-mini, and OpenAI o4-mini-high)
* Access to Deep Research
* Higher limits on advanced features (file uploads and data analysis)
* Access to research previews of GPT‚Äë4.5
* Access to GPT‚Äë4.1, a model optimized for coding tasks
* You can create and use Projects, tasks.

### Claude

Free model can be used for chat and data analysis.

Claude's paid tier gives:

* More usage -- see details on [limits](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/9797557-usage-limit-best-practices)
* Access to Projects to organize chats and documents
* Web access
* Extended thinking for complex tasks

## Other cool stuff I use

### Notebook LM

[Google's Notebook LM](https://notebooklm.google/) can "understand" any material (research papers, etc), summarize and relate to other topics. It can create an audio summary, which is fun, like a podcast. Here is an audio summary of [my research paper on cultural homophily](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/655d48f9-bff7-4ac3-908b-5b9bc48e5be4/audio).

### Github Copilot

Github Copilot sits inside your code editor like Rstudio, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, and helps write code. Good for writing often used stuff like loops or graphs.

There is an Education, free access for students: [GithubEducation](https://github.com/education/students)

### Cursor

[Cursor AI](https://www.cursor.com/) is the most popular AI code editor, I have very limited experience, but software developers love it.

## Feedback
Dear reader. I have limited experience. Suggestions are most welcome, please post an issue.
