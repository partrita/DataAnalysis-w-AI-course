title: "Austrian Hotel Datasets"
---

## Overview

This dataset contains realistic, simulated data for hotels across Austria, designed for practicing data cleaning and table joining. It consists of several related tables that can be combined using various join operations.

**Used in:** Week 4 (Joining Tables)

**Created by:** Claude AI (Sonnet 3.7), with realistic relationships between variables

## Dataset Structure

The dataset includes 8 related tables covering hotels across Austrian cities, their occupancy, pricing, tourism statistics, and economic indicators.

### Core Tables

| File | Description | Rows | Key Columns |
|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| `hotels.csv` | Basic hotel information | 200 | `hotel_id` (PK) |
| `cities.csv` | City information | 10 | `city` (PK) |
| `monthly_occupancy.csv` | Monthly hotel performance metrics | ~3,800 | `hotel_id`, `month`, `year` |
| `city_tourism.csv` | Monthly tourism stats by city | 240 | `city`, `month`, `year` |
| `economic_indicators.csv` | Monthly economic indicators | 24 | `month`, `year` |
| `reviews.csv` | Hotel guest reviews | ~1,700 | `review_id` (PK), `hotel_id` (FK) |
| `amenities.csv` | List of possible hotel amenities | 10 | `amenity_id` (PK) |
| `hotel_amenities.csv` | Hotel-amenity relationships | ~1,000 | `hotel_id`, `amenity_id` |

## Key Relationships

- **One-to-one:** Hotel ↔ City (via city name)
- **One-to-many:** Hotel → Monthly Occupancy, Hotel → Reviews
- **Many-to-many:** Hotel ↔ Amenities (via `hotel_amenities`)
- **Composite Keys:** Monthly data requires `(hotel_id, month, year)` or `(city, month, year)`

## Documentation

- **`hotel-data-readme.md`** - Detailed schema documentation with column descriptions and data types

## Learning Objectives

This dataset allows students to practice:
- Inner, left, right, and full joins
- One-to-one and one-to-many relationships
- Composite key joins
- Data aggregation after joins
- Handling missing values in joins

## Sample Research Questions

- How do hotel prices vary by city and season?
- What is the relationship between amenities and guest ratings?
- How do economic indicators affect hotel occupancy rates?
- Which cities have the highest tourism-to-hotel capacity ratio?
