- **`WVS_subset.csv`** - Selected variables from the full dataset (all respondents, Waves 1-7)

### Documentation
- **`codebook.pdf`** - Official WVS codebook with variable definitions and survey methodology
- **`README_WVS.md`** - Data processing documentation and variable descriptions

### Code
- **`cleaning.R`** - R script to process raw WVS data and create cleaned datasets

## Data Structure
