66,"Incredible the result, that’s basically to sum up, the dominance, the superiority in relation to the opposition and everything we did to try to win the game and that’s it, we didn’t get what we deserve clearly, but there is an element about putting the ball in the back of the net, with the amount of situations, chances, penalties that we had. We go home extremely sad but I cannot be prouder of my players, the team, individually, collectively what they have produced, on Wednesday night against TEAM, against two top teams, it’s incredible. We haven’t got rewarded and that’s the downside to it. 
To him and to all of them, that I love them, that we all love them individually and as a team they are a joy. What this team produces every three days is incredible regardless of what happens. And I'm not going to lose sight of that because of our results or for two because we didn't deserve those results. What can we do better. Let's try to do it. It's very difficult to achieve. It's an emotional part. It's something related to confidence as well. But it’s very difficult to ask something else from our players.
No, but I mean, we miss from various ways, from different plays. And I understand that, but I cannot love our players more. And I focus very much on the ones that we have to perform at the highest level. That's it. The rest is not in our hands, in my hands
But that's the outcome. Obviously relying on not performing like this. I don't want to bet on that. I bet on that team to try. Are we going to win big trophies? I don't know. But playing like this there are very few teams in the world that can play at that level.
I understand the point, but it's a remarkable week to understand what we did again today after what happened three days ago and what we did to two of the best teams in the moment right now. So this is what I take from the result. I understand that and it’s extremely disappointing but I cannot put my focus on that. I think it will be very, very, very unfair.
The first one that happens, when you want to take responsibility and leadership in a team, it can happen. PLAYER missed it. What I loved is that when I asked them, OK, who wants to take it? PLAYER was the first one in the sheet because I want to take it. And that's the players that we want. You're going to have difficult moments. It's how you respond to them. and PLAYER 's the captain and the leader. And I love that PLAYER's done that today again.

85,"On the whole, I'm pleased with the performance that we showed. We've created chances at key moments in the game. We had PLAYER hit the woodwork, then she also had a header that went just wide. When you look at those and the timing of those, it has a big impact. That's where we're trying to change the way that we finish in front of goal and take more of those opportunities. 
In terms of the second half, I couldn't be more proud of the players performances
We played well in the first half, but there were moments that cost us. But, for large parts of the game, we managed the threat that TEAM were able to put us under.
They're a very good footballing team and you have to manage a lot of different problems. As a collective, we solved a lot of those issues throughout the course of the first half, but second half, we were just better in terms of being more proactive, pressing with intent and energy. 
Cohesively, it was much, much better, and it was probably one of our best 45 minutes of the season, and we'll be able to take a lot out of it. 
There's so many things involved in winning football matches. There's talent, there's work ethic, there's character and so many others, and I feel as though we've done everything that we possibly could in that second half to create chances.

105,"We showed that in the past games also when we were losing in difficult moments. We disconnect in the beginning of the second half, it was a tough moment for us, like 10 minutes. And then we return, I think we did a great job. I think if you look at all the game, I think we were the best team but they were more clinical. The fight from the team was really important for me.
Yeah, you could see it and feel it in the stadium. The team were comfortable and we dominated the possession. I don’t think it was the last pass, I think it was the last shot because, in my mind, PLAYER [had] two times in the same position. It can happen.
We know that this team play with a high line. When they switch sides, they try to push us so we tried to take advantage of that. I felt a little bit a lack of physicality in those balls because we had the position and we have to work on that. Overall, it was a good match but there is no taste in that. We need to focus on the next game.
It’s to start and in these types of games, we need to have long possession in the next possession. Then we started losing the ball again, we started doing bad passes in the build-up when the team is open so we were a little bit nervous in that moment. But then we managed to recover, it’s not easy but it was not enough.
I will think about that tomorrow. Tonight I don’t feel nothing. There is nothing I can say to you. Tomorrow I will have a lot of things because I saw the game. Tonight we have to take a night to think and then tomorrow we will have a lot of good things from this game.
We cannot think in that way, that winning silverware makes everything okay. It will be a long way.

It’s hard to maintain high lines and compact distances against a team with TEAM’s possession stats.
Our players worked tirelessly, but when you’re defending constant waves of attack, focus can slip, and they punish any lapse.
The players who came on fitted in well. Everyone gave everything, but world-class sides like TEAM expose any weaknesses.
We’ll learn from this and aim to stay stronger for 90 minutes.
Motivation isn’t an issue. We knew the challenges of this league—there are essentially two leagues within one.
Some games are about containing top teams; others are chances to go on the front foot. We’ll regroup and focus on upcoming matches where we can impose ourselves more.

Many parts of the game, many parts of football we did really well, but one very important part, defending our box, we did terribly today.
In the first-half after crosses we have to do better. A top team like TEAM, they punish you if you give them too much space in your box.
That was the disappointing part today, but I think how we played, the goal we scored was amazing. The chances we created, how we pressed them in many situations was really good. But the crucial part is defending our box, and this was not good enough today.
We wanted to make it a little bit more open, playing with more bravery, that’s why we could create several chances.
PLAYER’s in great shape. PLAYER had two big chances straight after half-time and this is also what top teams are doing. The efficiency was really outstanding from the other team.
PLAYER is getting better and better, and we are really delighted with PLAYER’s performances.

101,"Yeah, I’m very happy with the result, very happy for the club and the players.
It was very much different. They went high in an aggressive press, player for player last week and today, they came out in a mid-block and zonal, and tried to close down spaces for us, which they did really well. It was a puzzle for us to try to figure out how we were going to break that down. We found some solutions in the second half, so we created a little more space and better areas to cross from, and then we had the players coming for us to make the difference today again.
Yeah, I think so! It’s a combination; you have to be opportunistic as well, we needed to be optimistic, we really wanted to win today, but we felt that the way we were playing, in our structure and the type of game we were playing, we felt like we were going to create; we were sticking with what we were doing and just trying to be a little bit more optimistic.
It was just a very impressive block of the team. The players have been stepping up big time, they’ve been owning this; we tried to relay it back to them all the time, so giving them the ownership. I’m just very happy with how the block has been, different challenges along the way, so all games have asked something different from us.

63,"Gutted, because I think we deserved to win from the beginning to the end. We did almost everything that we had to. But this is the quality of the opposition. And then the margins of the league as well. For millimetres we could have been sitting here after a really strong and dominant performance against a really good team.
They are really well organised. This is football. When we played them at home last year the margin was huge for us. That’s the quality of every opposition. You cannot cry about it. That’s the beauty of this league too. The beauty of this team too is how they are able to play today, even in this circumstances and against good opposition. I’m really happy for that.
I think it’s a great thing that we can again score from a set piece. We can generate other stuff, we had other chances. For a team to play like this you have analyse every phase. Obviously against a low block you generate set pieces and you generate crosses because it’s really difficult to attack inside.
But it was offside, no? I imagine that if they give it it’s offside. That emotionally was tough because we were so happy and we really dug in to take it and it was taken away.
That’s the quality of opposition. We cannot feel sorry for ourselves. We have to stand up for ourselves. We had a really good performance against a really good side. Normally you don’t see these kind of games here. Now we have to continue to improve and look at what we can do better so that the opposition have zero chances to win the game. That’s the objective.
We really wanted it. We have good momentum and it was a really crucial moment for us to go for it. We certainly did. We certainly tried and we were so close to doing it. Unfortunately we didn’t manage to achieve it.
Yeah but as well because we want to win deserving to win against any kind of opposition. When they are able to change something we are still able to adapt and be so dominant and good in the game. That’s the thing. It’s all about us because we don’t know what the opposition is going to do. If we continue to play at this level with the threat that we are we are going to win a lot of games.
It’s not ideal. We know that when we have consistency there how much that's giving us as well, but that's a different season. It brings in different challenges, we try to face them in the best possible way, the players are certainly doing the same, and we're going to continue on that route. 
It's never enough if you don't score three, four or five. We want to improve in everything that we absolutely do. If they play 11 or 12 direct balls there, I want to win 11. If it's 12, then 12. If we win the high press and we release the unit out wide and they want to play, six times, six times. And when we manage the game, we want to management the game 100 per cent. That’s football. 
Yes, but I’m really pleased with the performance of PLAYER and we had to change the whole unit as well. We had PLAYER there and PLAYER on the left which we’ve never played before and PLAYER as a full back, and okay PLAYER does it. PLAYER comes in and was excellent. That’s it, they were not available and we have to respond to that and I’m very happy with the way the team did. 
Yes, it starts with the will that they have because they understand and recognise the situation that we are in, that we’ve been in since the start of the season and they’re trying to help the team by really feeling it because we’re asking them to do things they’ve never done and they’re really buying into that and trying their best, so that’s a positive.
Fair? Yeah, for sure. If there was something unfair, it’s for the referee to decide. I don’t think there was any issues there. 
Yes, for sure. We are a real threat and it’s nothing simple to do. 
I don’t know, I can’t promise you that with different personnel that wouldn’t happen. It was a really random situation and then sometimes you have to clap the opposition.

70,"We all feel the same. On the one side of course we are really happy and pleased, but the feeling is that we would have deserved more.
When we see the game, having many more shots over the whole game, creating so many really good chances for scoring goals, it feels like we would have deserved a win.
I think today, especially all the players and all the fans here at STADIUM deserved this celebration right at the end.
I felt just happy for everyone, for the players, because when you're outside, you watch the game and sometimes you think: ‘come on, how can this happen?’ [With us] really being in balance, being very, very stable in defending and creating chances and not scoring from it, and it just feels sometimes…
I think maybe we can't play better in creating five, six clear chances to score goals. Sometimes I look to the screen and I thought: ‘come on, what's going on here?’
I'm really pleased, and it's the character of this team that we always keep going, playing forward, because it was mentally a really tough game, missing so many chances, and always believing – so big credit to the players, and big credit to our fans who supported us until the end of the game.
These emotions you can't buy, you have to deserve, and I think everyone here today – maybe not the TEAM supporters! – but everyone else deserved these emotions today, and goes home now and enjoys Saturday evening.
I personally don't enjoy this evening, because I think we played fantastic, and now it's [time to] recharge all the batteries and then go into next match and take the three points there.
It doesn't look like it is, but we are improving in our habits. The players play more and more games together, and we get players back. PLAYER today, PLAYER had PLAYER’s first start since weeks, PLAYER was back again, so this is very, very positive.

11,"No, I don’t think so. I can’t remember it. Although I don’t feel any pride in the substitution because you make a substitution because you have a certain game plan for why you do this. In this situation, we brought an attacker in for a defender just to play even more attacking football than we already did because we needed a goal - or goals. Then scoring from set-pieces was not something I had in my mind when I brought the two of them in, but of course PLAYER can score a goal and PLAYER has a good set-piece.
I couldn’t have asked for more today. I think most people talk about the second half - that they are really positive about the second half. If you ask me, I am also more positive about the second half than the first half, but if you play at this ground against this team, who are in such good form, hardly concedes a chance in every single game - and I have watched many of them back... so many counter-attack threats, almost every game they have counter-attack after counter-attack after counter-attack. We conceded only one counter-attack here today in 98 minutes of football of total domination. Unfortunately for us, that ball immediately went in.
Then in the second half, our ball possession also led to a lot of chances. You have to give credit, again, to TEAM because the way they defend, they throw themselves in front of shots, in front of every cross and then there is a goalkeeper that has an outstanding season this year and tonight again. Being down over here and it’s so hard to score against this team, it’s not what we wanted, but in the end what I want, what the fans should want and what the players should want is that they give it all they [have] got during every single game they play. That is what they did today, combined with outstanding football in the second half.
I think you saw today again that I can still strengthen the team or impact the game with the substitutes I have on the bench. Not for the first time this season, these players have helped us, that I could bring in. If you look at today, like I said, I couldn’t have asked for more. I said to them at half-time don’t get frustrated, you will not get many chances, probably the game is going to be slow, but just keep focusing on what you have to do and hopefully you will get two or three chances and let’s try to score from that. I was completely wrong because they created chance after chance after chance.
I wouldn’t say unique, but the playing style suits the players really well and I think this is what is the job of every manager: to try to find a playing style that suits your players. What makes it difficult, and we faced it not only against them but we faced it a bit against TEAM as well, is they play the long ball and they have some very good players for this. So, first of all you have to make sure you win the first ball and then the second or the third ball because they play the ball off PLAYER, who is a very strong, and then they have got these quick forwards that can hurt you as well.
But then the moment you win the second or the third ball there are 11 players behind the ball and it is so difficult to score against teams that play in a low block; it’s so difficult to create chances against teams like that. And yeah, that’s why for us it was such a disappointment that we went down because then they could even play their style even better, which made it a difficult evening for us because apart from the TEAM players that I have to give compliments, I have to give the fans compliments as well because they were really there for the home team and tried to influence the game as much as they could. They were a big help for TEAM tonight.
I said already before the game that after 20 games you can judge the table much better than in the first five, six, seven, eight, nine or 10 games and if you are right up there with us and the other teams… and I don’t think they are here because of luck. It is for every team very hard and difficult to play against them. They’ve already had a few difficult away games, with TEAM away, TEAM away, with TEAM away, us away, playing us already twice. So, that shows you that they are a team that can compete for the top end of the league table. I also think, but you have to tell me if I am right, that they have had most of their players available until now for the whole season so I see almost the same line-up, and that is a quality for the coaching staff that they have as well.

It's a shame because it was another chance for us but congratulations to them because probably when you save so many shots on the line, the goalkeeper, the body, the desire from them was very high.
No, tonight's game, I don't think it's physical or condition. When you play and you don't create chances, you don't create nothing, and you are not dangerous, then you can say we probably we struggled physically, we are not good enough, or we are not fresh.

PLAYER again featuring for us, PLAYER is making some really positive progressions, and I’m pleased to see that. And the frontline changed again a little bit, so that was good for us.

86,"I'm really pleased with the performance from the players today. That's against the champions and the holders of the competition; this is a tough place to come. 
I thought we showed grit and determination, we worked incredibly hard for each other and created some chances. 
The players did what I asked of them. They have it everything and that's all you could really want from a game like today. 
We played with no fear out there.
The players made a brilliant start to the game, making sure that we put them under pressure and we didn't back off. 
We expect TEAM to have a lot of the ball and create chances, but actually, one of the best thing about today was the control from the team, the mindset and the desire to play. 
We had little spells where concentration levels drop and tiredness sets in, and you have those little moments where you need to try and kick on again. 
We absorbed the pressure really well and we never really looked like we were panicking despite the fact we faced some pressure. All of those things helped us build resilience. 
We were delighted to have PLAYER and PLAYER available for us today. 
They've done everything that they can to try and affect the team and have been brilliant. They've only trained with us for just over a week, and it's a big ask for them to then play minutes for us today, but they stepped into that really well. 
You can see the quality that they have, and their experience and leadership is going to really help us.
We also had PLAYER making PLAYER’s first start for us this season as well, so we're starting to get some of the squad depth back and fit as well, which is really important. 
Since the start of the season, there's always been that work ethic. 
Everyone has been working really hard and we're moving forward. There's always been that desire to play when we want to play, we're creating chances and increasing the possession that we're having and we're getting more bodies on the grass. 
Moving into the next couple of weeks, I think we're building on what we said at the start of the season.
It was always going to be a process, we were going to need to develop the squad and we were going to need to evolve the team.

59,"The worst thing of the night, for sure, is the result, because the performance, the attitude, the dominance that we showed against one of the best teams in COUUNTRY in this stadium, I haven’t seen it in all the other games that I’ve watched but the reality is the result and we participated in that because we had many situations that we can resolve much better in front of goal and then extremely frustrated as well because there are two decisions that at the end marks the result and the course of the game.
I don’t understand [the decision], it’s just a deflection, there is no danger at all, you cannot react because you are very close but ok, they decide that is a penalty. But then if that’s a penalty then the one on PLAYER when PLAYER punches PLAYER in the head has to be 1000% a penalty and these are the margins in this game and it’s very very difficult to accept.
The concern tonight is the result and obviously in both boxes at the end we didn’t do what we have to do. When we didn’t, then someone else didn’t and that’s it. For sure, this is the way that I want to see my team. All the big games that we have by far this was the best one that we played in the last few years.
There’s nothing unfortunately that we can do, we are not going to be able to change it so, unfortunately, we have to accept it and move on.
We were told at the start of the season that wasn’t a penalty, that was clear. Today was a different story. Regarding PLAYER, yeah, PLAYER’s got a big cut. PLAYER needed to come off because PLAYER needed some stitches, but hopefully PLAYER’s going to be okay for the weekend. 
PLAYER was not concussed. But yesterday and today PLAYER was already not feeling great. After, when I looked at PLAYER, I decided to take PLAYER off because I need PLAYER 100%. 
It was a private, interesting conversation. 
I told them that I’m proud of them. I haven‘t seen them play in the manner that we have today.

23,"I think it [making 11 changes] worked if we analyse the performance. If we analyse the result, then it didn’t work.
But I think for 23 minutes, we were in control of the game and didn’t concede anything. Then after, we lost control for ten minutes and then for the last ten minutes of the first half, we created two or three clear-cut chances and in the second half we were in control of the game.
So I know the most important thing is the result but with the performance, it was the result because of ten minutes and for the rest we were quite good.
I didn’t see a big difference [in how TEAM played tonight]. I think in the last game they were more or less in the same way as tonight, trying to be aggressive. Today I think we did quite well.
The first goal is one we can avoid because we know playing through the middle, we know they are quite aggressive so the solution was to go outside but it can happen.
I didn’t see a big difference between tonight and Sunday. 
We need to get better at many things but we didn’t concede any chances from their pressing three days ago because we contacted not with the first line – on Sunday it was PLAYER and PLAYER and tonight it was PLAYER, PLAYER and PLAYER – we always tried to contact with the second line because we know they are very aggressive.
Two days ago, we did very well and I think we did very well tonight. But for sure we have many things we can do better.
No, it was simply because PLAYER and PLAYER were doing very well and it was just in case we needed PLAYER but because PLAYER and PLAYER were doing well, there was no need to change.",-0.2,0,Neutral,4,3,-0.333333333,0.888888889,-0.333333333,-1,0,0,117,31/10/2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024/2025,enzo maresca,6,chelsea,33,newcastle utd,76,chelsea,33,newcastle utd,76,st james park,0,2,0,1.74,1.62,1.74-1.62,0,2,-2,1.62,1.74,-0.12,-1.88,0,0,1,NA,NA
89,"We’re massively disappointed with the result. We’ve hit some really positive form leading into this game, but we didn’t come out of the blocks at the pace that we have been playing. Today was a missed opportunity for us. We just weren’t quite assertive enough; we didn’t have enough support in and around the ball. Collectively, we could have done more to help each other out and stick to the gameplan. 
We did have chances in the first half, so it was disappointing not to be able to create more. We were a little indecisive in dealing with things. We had opportunities that weren’t too far away. 
PLAYER had an opportunity, plus another from a set play as well, where we were inches away from making contact with the ball. I’m pleased that we’ve created them, but I just think we’ve got to be ruthless in those moments and take the chances. 
I think missing those chances sometimes creates a little bit of a mindset issue, where you’re thinking that it is maybe not going to be our day, and players feel that as well. But I think we’ve got to get better at being able to see that it’s not ideal, but keep working really hard, do the basics really well and that will get us back into our flow and the feel of the game. 
I’d like to thank the fans for traveling and supporting the team today. We’re really appreciative and grateful for their support. We want to give good performance to our fans every week. It’s disappointing for us all today, but I was delighted with the support that they’ve given us.

69,"Today, it's easy to sum up the game. TEAM were the better team. They were very aggressive, played very direct with a lot of pace in their attacking.
Then we made too many mistakes. When we had situations maybe to come back into the game, we didn't take them. Then, the red card: again, a mistake we made… inaccurate passing, a tackle in their half, and then a red card. Then, playing against a very good TEAM side...
We have to accept it, and I don't look for an excuse that we missed some players. I think the team that played today could have done better in many situations.
I think we didn't have this determination in possession. We played too slow, we were always looking, and looking, and looking.
Overall, if you make so many mistakes, this means you lose more and more your confidence. I think we started quite well after half-time, in the second-half. We had our situations, and then with the red card, to be honest, it looked like the game was over.
I think today we had several players who were not in their best shape. They can do it better, and this is what it is now for us to get back because we did really well the last week, and now several players are leaving us [for international duty], and others have to rest.
We could see some players looked a little bit tired, but not just physically tired. They were a little bit mentally tired, and this is what we have to get back: the freshness, the sharpness, and of course the other players [from injury].",-1.06,-2,Strongly negative,5,10,-1.38,0.456,-0.825,-1,-1,-0.555,25,09/11/2024,NA,11,sat,15:00 (16:00),2024/2025,oliver glasner,8,crystal palace,36,crystal palace,36,fulham,45,fulham,45,selhurst park,1,0,2,1.96,2.25,1.96-2.25,0,2,-2,1.96,2.25,-0.29,-1.71,0,0,1,25142,michael salisbury
54,"First of all congratulations to TEAM, it's unbelievable what they have done. Since December we’ve been on an incredible journey with every performance has been at the highest level we have seen and it still wasn’t enough, this is the level. Today is mixed emotions, first of all to be really proud of those players, the staff they have done an incredible job, they have pushed every limit, every margin that we could find and unfortunately it was a bit short. 
It is the second season so there’s only one way to do it, you have to be more determined, you have to be more ambitious, you need to have a lot of courage and push every limit and everything that we have, because that’s the next step.
The first one and most important is how we are going to get these players to a different level, that’s my first job. After that, visualising that we still don’t have enough to do that for sure we’re going to do everything we can to fill those gaps.
When you look in the last 15, 20 years of this league and the competition wasn’t like it is today, for sure, you are the champion. But this is not enough, but this is as well, probably we are getting better and better and better and faster because someone is so good you have to chase it, and that’s what makes you good as well. We cannot feel sorry for ourselves, we tried, we are improving. It was an unbelievable season again.
In everything, in the way they compete, the way they talk about the future, the way they talk about what they are capable of doing, what we are capable of doing as a team, I sense a real belief there. They are really determined, before I didn’t have that feeling they really want to win and go toe-to-toe and look in the eyes of every opponent. Now I feel that.
I don’t think so, we are still there to win and that’s the motivation.

106,"It was two different parts. We play 45 minutes without one man. It was tough for us, [but] we didn’t suffer a lot of chances. Even with 10 men, we are near their goal during the second half but, again, one set-piece changes the game, [and makes it] even harder. We controlled the first half. Sometimes we lose the ball, TEAM make some transitions, but we are in control of the game. We had a little bit of a lack of aggression in the last third but we were in control in the game. Then we have the second half to do something more, but then the player is sent off, it’s really hard for us.
I saw last week against TEAM. PLAYER cannot go to the ball because he has one player in front and one in the back and in the last moment, [when] PLAYER’s jumping, just a touch in PLAYER’s back can change the way you see the ball.
Some PLAYERs are not even looking to the ball. But I don’t want to focus on that. The good thing is we were near the goal even with 10 men, we continue our job.
That situation was good because you can feel it, even in the stadium and the other team. We pushed the other team with 10 men, near their box, but in the end, lots to improve.
We have to improve the relationships but we have some moments, I think we lack a little bit of aggression, but we train, we try to find a better way to win games, but we controlled the games. I think we were always in control, not always dominating, but in control, but the same things, set-pieces and also the sending off was really hard for us.

At half-time, the players took on the information we gave them, and as soon as the whistle blew for the restart, they put in a performance that we’re really, really proud of.
They did everything I asked them to do. People came on and impacted the game in a calm, controlled manner, not just all guns blazing, which was exactly what we needed.
But once again, we were punished in the dying moments, and we’ve got to defend those situations better.
We had a couple of great chances early on, and we didn’t take them. If we had, the game could have been a totally different story.
It’s frustrating because we’ve been in that position before, but the second-half reaction showed just how far we’ve come as a group.
The first game of the season, we lost big. That was a rude awakening into the league. Today, we took a quality side like TEAM right to the death.
It’s cruel, but that’s football. We’ve got to believe we’ll put sides on the other end of that as the season progresses.

84,"It's a difficult result to take. I think if you've watched the game, you would've seen how good of a performance we've put in, but obviously, if you're just looking at the result then that's probably a little bit of a different reflection really. But in terms of how the players applied themselves today, I can't really fault the way that they've gone about the game. 
We showed grit, determination and character all the way through
We dominated the ball, we dominated opportunities and we're disappointed that we've let players get free opportunities in terms of couple of set plays. At the end, I think if we had just continued to do what we had done all game which was to really get up against them and press with intent and desire - that forced loads of turnovers and opportunities from us but we just didn't quite do it on the edge of the box.
I think we deserved a different result on the performance overall; it's one of our more complete performances, we've just not finished when we've had the opportunities.
It's like chalk and cheese to compare this game to last weeks. To be honest, we played for 40 minutes last week really, in total. The players are aware of that, and we've spoken about it. We want to be able to deliver essentially what we delivered against TEAM and TEAM. 
When you look at the quality that we've had on the ball today there's loads of positives to take 
Obviously, we're disappointed with the result but the way that we're dictating the game, stringing things together and the way that the team is evolving is a really good response, in terms of performance, compared to last week. We started quicker than we did last week, and so there's lessons to be learned week in week out. 
As I’ve always said from the start, it takes time, and we started off really well in the league, and, make no mistake, we're fighting for points every single week. I think the biggest thing is that we've just got to keep going and believe in the process. 
We dominated the game today, it's just about taking those chances when we get them 
We had other opportunities from set plays, one just went a little bit wide, and a good save tipped it onto the bar. We had our chances, but it just comes down to being the best in both boxes, because in the other parts of the pitch, we've dominated the game effectively. 
I think we had probably 10 minutes at the start of the second half where they made an adjustment, and we just had to manage that a little bit differently because of the position PLAYER was taking up. Once we did that, we were much more aggressive again and got on the front foot and changed the momentum back in our favour. 
It's a hard one to take.
We need everybody firing on all cylinders. Naturally with a lot of young players, you have peaks and troughs with that in terms of performances and so really, it's an opportunity for some of them to show that they're ready to play in league games.

119,"For sure frustrated about the performance today. When we talk about ambitions, we need to turn words into actions. I need my players to be ready from the beginning of the game.
If you analyse this game, the first half was not intense enough from us. We did not show our intentions and I think we got punished for that. The second half was better - we created more chances and opportunities. We were not efficient enough.
I'm frustrated because we have talent in the team, but we didn't show that in the first half. The players need to realise this is a competitive league and if you don't show up from the start, you don't get good results.
It's even more frustrating for me because when the other team plays a really good game, you have to give credit to them. I give credit to TEAM because they were strong defensive. They were all together and mentally tough.
But, I think we have more talent than that. 
It's good now to see how we react. How we analyse the performance and how we move forward. We are going to stay together no matter what. That's really important.

36,"It has been a tough day. We had a big expectation and a mission to win this match, but it's true that I think that we started well.
We had chances but we didn't score before the half. I think that we had one penalty [appeal], and a clear chance that we needed to score to produce more in the second half.
So, we have to improve and to change these things to compete in the league.
We need the clean sheet as it is very important to be able to stay in the match. We are very, very, very sad, all of us, but we have to change our minds and our ambition for the next match against TEAM and to look forward despite [the fact that] today, we are very, very unhappy.
The referee can give us a penalty but for me, it's not a key question.
The key question is that we can't concede these kind of goals that we need to do to stay in the in the match until the trigger moments. Okay, we have to improve this.
We suffered against TEAM and TEAM too this kind of situation and we have to correct, to change and to improve this.
We are going to do that for sure and I think that if we want to compete in all the matches in the league, we have to be more consistent in this kind of approach.
It was a tactical decision to replace PLAYER [after 37 minutes], but when a player is replaced before the half it is not the fault of the player. It is the fault of the coach, so it is about me and not about PLAYER. Maybe I can do better if I change one player before the half. It is about this and trying to watch myself and not the player in these moments.
The message for supporters is first to say we are sorry about today.
We had a big expectation today, and we are going to do all that we can to do our best, to work more and to change things, for sure, because the season is going to be very, very long, very long and I am sure that this team is going to change a lot of things.

9,"It was a good goal, let that be clear. A ball in behind, a cut-back cross, PLAYER scoring, stayed really calm, finished it off, but I don't think you're interested in that. I think you're interested in the moment before. When I just walked in, something happened and I think TEAM weren't happy with a few decisions that were made on Sunday and many people always say that this will eventually match up in the end of the season.
I'm not one of them that believes that because sometimes you can be unlucky in a season, or lucky in a season. On Sunday, a decision went against them, maybe today a decision went in favour of them, which is, of course, very unlucky for us. Especially not after the first 15 to 20 minutes because I did feel TEAM started the game better than us. But after that, in my opinion, we had most of the game control, played most of the game in their half, had much more ball possession and then a moment like this, if you go down to 10 for a few seconds against a team that can play good football, like TEAM can, it's far from ideal.
I don't think there is any debate about that. They say he didn't stop the counter-attack. I think every manager would prefer if the tackle being made now 40 yards away from our goalkeeper – I don't think you really stop a counter-attack then – every manager would prefer to get a second yellow card for the other team than to finish that counter-attack with a player less to play that counter-attack with. If that is not a discussion then the next discussion is if it was reckless enough, [so] just give advantage, then just come back and say, 'Yeah, I thought the tackle was still too reckless.' So they still have to give a yellow.
In the VAR decision, REFEREE had to tell everyone what REFEREE decision was and unfortunately REFEREE didn't have to do this with this decision. Things happen. Very unlucky for us. [It's a] far from ideal starting position for us because they have a really good team, probably some players come back for the second leg. Then it would've been only this game.
I don't think we will reach that level in every single game we play. You can always expect a reaction from TEAM, which you saw today, you can always expect a reaction from the fans. We all know how important it is to us but also how important it is for the TEAM fans. We knew when we came here that it would never be the same game as we played here one week ago or two weeks ago, but still I saw a lot of things the same. I think even in that game the ball possession was equal, but now I think we had 60 to 40 [per cent]. There's many good things to take for me, more than the TEAM game, but the result was not as good as against TEAM.
I think you can't judge something on one game but if it's offside then I don't think anyone had to explain something. When REFEREE started explaining something, you saw a red and a blue line. I think it would be more interesting for everyone if REFEREE would've explained why REFEREE didn't give a second yellow card than explaining why REFEREE cancelled the goal, because that's what everybody could see on the screen. But I know that's not the rule. It's the rule to have these decisions when the VAR is involved, and the VAR was of course not involved in yes or no [for] a second yellow. In general, I think let's judge this not on an evening. Let's judge this if we see this a few more times.
I don't think I am known in COUNTRY for [being] the person who always stays calm with referee decisions! Although I do think they have the wrong opinion about me over there when it comes to refereeing decisions! The decision is made, you can't change it. When he didn't give the second yellow, nobody thought that it would have had such a big impact 30 seconds later. I think but I am 99.9 per cent sure I wasn't the only one who felt not the best [when the goal was scored]. I am 99.9 per cent sure when PLAYER scored the referee was like, 'Is this really happening?' because he couldn't change it anymore. It was, for him, also far from ideal, I think – but that's why I say 99.9 because I couldn't look into REFEREE’s head and REFEREE didn't have to tell what he felt.",1.5,2,Strongly positive,1,6,-0.216666667,0.855555556,-0.416666667,-2,-1,0.2,24,09/01/2025,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,tottenham,111,liverpool,64,tottenham,111,tottenham hotspur,0,1,0,0.98,1.32,0.98-1.32,0,1,-1,1.32,0.98,0.34,-1.34,0,0,1,NA,NA
56,"Well, I'm super happy, obviously. We know what it means to our club, to our people, and we have the power to try to make them very happy. So hopefully we have achieved that and that makes it very special. On the performance we had moments in the game, some really good ones, some others that we have to suffer. We suffered because we have to adapt a little bit the plan because of the players that we had available. 
I loved it because since the day that we started to get by, the team got hungrier and hungrier to play the game and that's a big compliment to everybody at the club to behave in a certain way. It's a tough week that's coming up, and instead of finding any little excuses or arguments to do that - the opposite, face the challenge, play with courage, acknowledge our qualities and what we have to be able to do to win a game.
The people that we have, I think I already spoke about it during the week, people that are harder, they have thick skin, they love the game and they love winning. In order to love the game and win, you have to do a lot of things - sometimes people call them ugly. Enjoying doing those ugly things is a big compliment of this team right now, and when you're able to normally, you get a good gift.
I don't know when's the last time that this has happened, so that's a big thing. I think they believe already, we've won a lot of big games. It’s a big week coming up and that's going to give us a lot of energy and belief. Obviously, there are a lot of things to get better today. I don't think we've done, especially with the ball, the simple things right at all. We will get better.
In PLAYER’s field, in other fields, as a person, the relationship that we have, that's why I made a decision to bring PLAYER to TEAM when I was there and then to TEAM. Hmm and the staff, they have injected the belief to the players that there are many ways to win football matches and that this is a really powerful one. PLAYER's given us a lot, so big compliment to all of them.
I made two changes with the front players and suddenly PLAYER's down. So I looked at the bench and the options that we had, so we had to adapt. I don't know exactly what it is, but PLAYER could not continue.
I didn't enjoy it because I didn't sleep much. I looked at TEAM for four or five days. I had a super clear plan, how to do it. I prepared everything, the session, the meeting, etc, and then one news, we lose a player. Another news, we lose another player. Another news, we lose a player. So I had to completely change it.

87,"I’m proud of my players today. The way that we went about the game, the way that we played and showed resilience, grit, determination, as well as quality on the ball, I think it’s all a massive testament to the progress that we’ve made. 
The result is disappointing for everybody because the players have given their heart and soul out on the pitch. I thought we did really well in terms of how we managed the opposition and how we limited their opportunities. Unfortunately, a couple of clearances dropped onto the edge of our box, and it’s very difficult for PLAYER in those scenarios. 
We have a massive positive, the desire and the attitude of the players. I’m really proud of them today. 
There’s positives to take out of the game, once again.
I genuinely think we’ve got better and better at the resilience and our mindset going into games has definitely improved. I think we’ve learned a lot from the first half of the season, when things have gone our way and maybe haven’t, and we have to be able to be resilient in those moments.
But for the whole match today, we stayed the course and we kept to our gameplan. 
There are so many positives to take out of the game, but it’s literally just a couple of things that we’ve got to cut out that don’t give people the sort of chances. 
Frankly we’ve not been helped out by the referee today. It’s clear that there was a player impeding PLAYER, so that’s a difficult one to take as well.
Our new signings are helping us on and off the pitch.
That's a reason why brought senior players in to add experience, leadership and quality to the team. You can see it in the way to PLAYER moves across the pitch, creating problems for teams on and off the ball. 
PLAYER got 30 minutes today, which is positive. Straightaway, you can see the quality that PLAYER has playing forward and the options that PLAYER creates for us. 
All of the new signings have been huge assets, and that’s on top of the players that have worked hard to keep improving over the course of the season. 
The big thing is that we keep trying to make sure that the new players are gelled within the team and fit in as quickly as possible.

90,"We had a better first half in terms of how we controlled the game that what we have had recently. We’ve been quite slow to start some games, so it was something that we’d really been focusing on. 
If I’m honest, I can’t understand how the goal stands based on the foul on PLAYER and the fact that PLAYER’s got a cut on the head from studs being up in that situation. It’s a bit of a blow and a bit deflating.
Fair play to the players because straight after that, we created two massive chances before half-time and we want to be more clinical in taking those. 
It would have put us in a good position heading into the break if we had been able to do so. 
At times in the second half, we were a little flat. 
We were obviously trying to change the energy with the players who we were bringing off the bench. TEAM are good at making the game directional, transitional and all of a sudden, you’re in a physical battle for the majority of the game, and I feel like we’ve got to get better at competing with that. 
Part of the conversation at the end of the game was that we’ve got to expect that side of the game and we have to deal with that a little bit more. 
For the players, I think they feel a little bit deflated by some of the decisions today. 
However, it’s important that we pick ourselves up and work really hard moving forwards into next week’s game. 
We have to take the positives that we can from the game, particularly the first half because it’s the best that we’ve started a game for a while and doing that throughout the course of a game is going to be the key focus for us moving forward. 
We’ve been playing well at home recently and making things really difficult for teams. 
The team are determined, we’re working hard every day and we’ll go into the game and do everything we can to get points.

Also, as a manager, I decided to rotate my squad, so sometimes it can happen that the players don't get the same chemistry together. But I wanted to have a better impression from my team. I'm really happy with the result, but not really happy with the performance. We were not efficient enough tonight.
Every game is always an opportunity to learn. Tonight I learned a lot and I will share that with my players as a team, but also as individuals.
There are some positives. With our squad, we are still able to rotate players and rest some. We have the result, so we stay in the good dynamic for that, but in terms of the performance, we needed to do a better job in different aspects.
It's a positive thing, we didn't really get stressed about the situation. I think we could have done more.

8,"I think many people, what stays in their head for a long time is what happens in the end and that was a big chance for PLAYER, of course. But what we tend to forget is two minutes before, PLAYER had maybe such a big chance. In the end, it was a difficult game. A bit similar to maybe the TEAM game, where the playing style of both teams was quite similar. Defending in a low block with a lot of bodies and if they had the ball, not the risk of build-up but play it long. Every free-kick they got somewhere in and around their own half or our half, they brought it in, so that was a bit similar to TEAM. That is not always easy then to play against that style of football and that’s what showed against TEAM and it showed again today. Especially if they have such good, quality players that can defend so well, then it is not so easy to play it through that low block that they had.
It’s not so easy to take control if the other team plays every ball into your last line, then the ball is constantly in the air and there’s constantly duels. That is, I think, what makes it difficult. We couldn’t control it completely because every time we had control, we had a shot on target, PLAYER put the ball on the ground and hit it long towards our half. Then the ball is open. Of course, we had to do much better in the goals we conceded, but that’s what every manager says, probably – MANAGER will tell you they had to do better in the goals we scored. Taking control against a team that plays almost every ball into your last line is not as easy as [against] another playing style.
I don’t believe in those things. I think nine out of 10 people will tell you it affected PLAYER but I am one of the 10 that tells you I don’t think that affected PLAYER. What affected PLAYER was that PLAYER had to play PLAYER and PLAYER, who are two starters for COUNTRY. Great, great, great players. We have a fantastic player here with PLAYER and mostly PLAYER is not playing for COUNTRY. That tells you how much quality TEAM have and if these players set themselves to a game, and that is what TEAM once in a while do, then it is very difficult to play against them. That is more difficult for PLAYER to play against PLAYER and PLAYER than the rumours there were during the week. That’s my opinion and probably everybody will tell you it had to do with the rumours. My opinion is different.
No, it wasn’t that he had to play them on his own, against those two, because PLAYER was nine out of 10 times close to that situation. But he was many times faced in a one-v-one situation against those players. Now, I always tell you how difficult it is for the other team to be in a one-v-one situation against PLAYER or against PLAYER, PLAYER or all the other ones we have. These players also have special qualities; I think the best way you could see this was the last 10 to 15 minutes. In the first 70 to 80 they almost played every ball long, but after the 2-2 the game was completely open and then you could even see even better how much quality they have if they try to play the ball over the ground. It was clear that PLAYER had some difficult moments, as we as a team had, but that is also for PLAYER not the first time. I think for the majority of the games PLAYER played for this club, they were very, very, very good, but I can’t believe if people tell me that PLAYER’s never played a bad game for this club. That has probably happened before, and I think mostly against quality players like TEAM have, especially in the positions PLAYER had to face.",0.84,2,Strongly positive,5,2,-1,0,-0.5,-1,-1,-0.5,13,05/01/2025,NA,20,sun,16:30 (17:30),2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,liverpool,64,manchester utd,71,manchester utd,71,anfield,1,2,2,2.86,1.67,2.86-1.67,2,2,0,2.86,1.67,1.19,-1.19,0,1,1,60275,michael oliver
64,"I feel very disappointed, because, obviously, if there’s a team that deserved to win, there’s only one. We dominated our play, not allowed them to run, no set pieces. High-press, excellent. We got them there. We generated the chances, but the last 20 metres was missing to score goals, which is what you have to do with all the dominance because we have never been able to dominate it that way. But at the end you have to try to generate the highest winning probability. You want more. Even if we win it, we always want more. But I cannot ask much more to the team.
Well, with PLAYER, I had to take PLAYER out because PLAYER was feeling something. And with PLAYER it was a tactical decision to try to change their rhythm, especially on that side.
I'm very disappointed because when you do what we've done today against them. But at the end, this is football, it’s the hardest thing. Those last 20- 25 meters to do what we have to do. Credit to them as well, how they block shots, PLAYER for the saves made, the way they defend, the desire that they defend with. But honestly, it's difficult to ask something else to the team. Individually, can we do things a little bit better and deliver more quality and deliver the magic moment? In that case that is necessary, yes, but that's something that is not easy.
That’s difficult. At the end you need the spark and you need to be precise. I mean, we had the chances, this could have been two or three nil, and nobody's talking about it. The reality is they're not going to talk about all the incredible things that the team did in the game. I mean, certainly, it's not energy. When I see my team track-back, it's unbelievable. Every three days, 70 metres, all the team is going there. So very difficult to ask them something else because they want it.
We have to manage the frustration. If nobody start to speed up the game, or there is no room to speed it up and we start to watch the game, we need to understand that nobody starts to force [the opponent] to make mistakes and to lose a grab of the game. We have to say very far away from that. 
If PLAYER comes in and scores a goal, is PLAYER a great sub? If PLAYER doesn’t, you have taken your captain out. That‘s football. 
It was the same reaction as PLAYER, anybody. I’m sure that they want to continue to play the 90 minutes. But that’s why we have the subs. To try to help the team. 
PLAYER has been with a little niggle for the last week or so. PLAYER has to be subbed in that moment. We have to do it.

111,"It's hard to explain. We have to acknowledge the moment and not go around the problem. Everybody here is underperforming. No matter the circumstances, we are underperforming and we have to accept it is unacceptable to lose so many games…for any club in the league, [let alone] TEAM. It is a really hard moment but we have to continue. There is no other way, we have to suffer and continue.
The opponent is better than us in many details, that we cannot be consistent, that I am not helping my players in the moment. It's a hard moment and we have to acknowledge we are in a very difficult situation, all the bad records - losing games at home, losing games in the league. We are really underperforming and we need to win games, that's all.
I knew it was going to be hard to put in a completely new idea in the moment. But when you lose games, you don't have that luck to win three games in a row, it's becoming really hard. That's why I'm telling [you] we are going to suffer because I'm going to continue to do the same. To help my players is to give them the tools to play this way, but, without training, it is really hard. Then, without training and losing games. You could feel it in the end of the game, everybody was changing position, and that is something I will not see again. We can lose, but we will not change position.
I just want to help my players. If I want to show to the media and the fans, I [would] put two strikers [on the pitch], I didn't put two strikers [on] because it is going to be more difficult for them to understand the way we play. I'm just here to try to help my players, but we need to understand that we are breaking all the bad records. It's a bad thing we need to change.
We’ve had a very bad start. I know that. If it's [like] this for a fan of TEAM, imagine what it's like for me. You are getting a new coach that is losing more than the last coach, I have full knowledge of that. Like I said, I'm not going to change, no matter what, and I know we can succeed. But we need to survive this moment because I’m not naive and I know that we need to survive now. We are being the worst team, maybe, in the history of TEAM, and I know that you want headlines but I'm saying that because we have to acknowledge that and change that.
In this moment, PLAYER is not here and, in the last games that we lost, PLAYER was not here. I don't want to put this moment on PLAYER. PLAYER is out of this moment because PLAYER's not playing. No matter what, I'm not going to put in a player I don't believe is best for the team.
They are used to different things. You have seen in your years of experience, sometimes, you have one team that almost wins the league and then, next season, is really bad, without confidence. Our players are really nervous in actions, when you go on the pitch, you remember the last games here. If I feel it, the players feel it a lot. The only way to fix this is continue to do the same and win games.
First of all, it's training. In everything we do. Even if the training is small…10, 15 minutes, we have to give everything. Then, we have to be prepared to suffer. It's the only way. We have to feel that feeling we felt against TEAM. We have to have to feel that every day. Even when we win, we need to have that feeling every day. I think in the training ground, during the week, is the best way to train that feeling.
We need to be really focused on the game and, sometimes, I've felt the team is focused on a lot of stuff. If there is one play that TEAM does, it's to push the centre-back [forward] and the winger makes the movement, and we knew that before the game. I don't want to point to that specific [moment], it's everything. The only way is to work really hard to

Today I think that we gave a big effort. We did and that is why we are very unhappy, above all, for our fans, and for the players too, because they made a big effort. It was a pity.
It’s true they were one of the best teams in the league in the last season, and maybe in the current season too, but I think that despite this, we equalised a very hard match in a lot of moments. In other moments, I think that we overcame them too, but it's about the goals.
We suffered very early, when we conceded from a set piece, and we have to improve about this for sure, all these things, because these little details are key. They allow you to take advantage of a lot of good work, and after we equalise the match, I think that we finished the first half better than them, in my opinion, and the start of the second half too.

They have a very good team, and in the end we had two very two clear chances to score in the end of the match, but we don't score. We are very disappointed with this, and we have to keep the good things that we showed and we did, and we have to improve the bad things to be more competitive.
We are here, and we have to think that we can’t stay talking about this [being early in our tenure], despite it being our first match.
You are right that PLAYER has been there three years, TEAM is a big team and is one in the league.

55,"It was a very emotional afternoon, for sure. We started the game really well, created three or four chances that we didn’t convert. After that we had a period with some issues, particularly with the ball and we lacked some dominance in that period. Then we go in at half-time, come back and we were really strong. Then the referee makes a decision that changes the course of the game. With 10 men, the team reacted unbelievably well, the stadium reacts unbelievably well.
I was amazed. Amazed, amazed, amazed because of how inconsistent decisions can be. In the first half, there were two incidents and nothing happened. Then, in a non-critical area, the ball hits PLAYER, PLAYER turns around, doesn’t see the player coming and touches the ball. By law, REFEREE can make that call, but by law then REFEREE needs to make the next call which is a red card. So we play 10 against 11. This amazed me, at this level.
Yes. Obviously PLAYER had a reaction. Anyway, I will repeat myself. By law, you want to do it but you didn’t do it in the first half. And then we have to play 11 against 10. Very simple
Yes for sure. During this period, how well we controlled the emotional part of the game because it was a really hard one to take. The team reacted and showed a lot of discipline. We adapted to what we had to do, playing at with 10 men and we don’t want to be sitting deep for so long. We played the game that we had to play and we should’ve been rewarded.

5,"Until 60, 65 minutes, I really, really, really enjoyed what I saw. Of course, we were caught one time in bringing the ball out from the back and that immediately led to a goal for TEAM. You think if we would have gone into the dressing room with a 2-1, that would not have done justice to all the chances we had. But then you also saw that no matter how much quality players have, if they think they don't have to run anymore then in this league, especially against TEAM because they are so good with the ball as well, they immediately start to create, and that's what they did and they scored.
It was very good – maybe it was our best performance away from home, although I really liked what I saw against TEAM as well. It was total dominance and we outplayed them many, many times also, so that was a very good away game as well. Today, I think we could have even scored more. It's always like this, you don't score every chance, although TEAM almost did because the first three chances were a goal, I think, and then the fourth one luckily enough didn't go in. PLAYER and PLAYER, they were both with two goals, maybe the ones that stand out in terms of scoring two. But I think we would not do justice to PLAYER 's performance if we don't name PLAYER as well because, apart from PLAYER’s attacking things PLAYER did today, he was without the ball also an important part of our game plan, and that's what PLAYER executed very well. Yes, these are the ones that score the goals, but if you watch the goals one more time back – and that's definitely what I am going to do – it mostly started off with centre-backs or full-backs. Every lead-up to a goal was, I think, multiple passes. So, it's not only the ones that score, it's also the ones that help to create.
I exaggerate a bit if I say they don't run anymore. Of course they still run, but they don't block crosses anymore, they don't defend in front of their goal. Until that moment, it was every time, wherever the ball was we were there with two, three, four players. Yes, maybe it is human that if you are up big you think, 'OK.' And I think in general it is also enough, because not many teams after being down just keep on going. But we know TEAM, they always keep on going and also have the quality to create because they are such an attacking threat. Every game they played, they create so, so, so many chances. So, you have to be on top of your game every second of the game. And if you are not 100 per cent then it immediately hurts you – not in every game but definitely against a well-managed side like TEAM.
I haven't seen all of PLAYER’s performances because this is my first year and PLAYER’s second. I just referred to the TEAM game and I think PLAYER was outstanding over there as well. If you score so many goals, that's always what stands out, but last week against TEAM, for example, if you look at the work-rate PLAYER did over there. It was a very good performance [from] PLAYER [today]. I think it wasn't PLAYER’s first great performance, but it was definitely one of PLAYER’s best, yes.
Of course, it means something because you always prefer to be where we are at the moment than to be in another position in the league table. You know, just as well as I know because I've won the league once, how hard it is to win it. You have to keep on going, keep on going. Every three days you have to be on top of your game, every minute of the game. That's why it is so hard to win it because it's not always easy to show up every three or four days. We saw last week, in a moment you can get a red card – which was quite a debate afterwards, not by me but by other people – and these things can happen in a season. 
You have an idea before you start working with players, but the best way to judge them – or to experience them – is when you start to work with them. I think PLAYER shows what PLAYER has shown for so many years at TEAM, that PLAYER can score a goal and the team just has to provide PLAYER to come into these positions where PLAYER came today many times. Then PLAYER is able to score goals or provide assists. Apart from PLAYER being a very good football player, I think PLAYER is a very likeable person to work with as well. PLAYER is always there to help teammates. PLAYER is always down to earth, so tomorrow – or even now, I think – PLAYER will work on PLAYER’s recovery. PLAYER understands what it takes to be at this level every three days and PLAYER is working really hard for that. So, that maybe impressed me most – that a top player like PLAYER understands how hard PLAYER has to work for the quality he shows.""",1.3,2,Strongly positive,14,9,1.688888889,0.414814815,1.388888889,1,2,0.3,79,22/12/2024,NA,17,sun,16:30 (17:30),2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,tottenham,111,liverpool,64,tottenham,111,tottenham hotspur,0,3,6,1.2,5.2,1.2-5.2,6,3,3,5.2,1.2,4,-1,1,0,1,61439,samuel barrott
18,"It was a game of very few chances for both sides. We had that big chance right by the end of the 90-minute period and that was our moment to win the game. We didn't take our chance, TEAM took their chance, each team had one big chance and there was not much in it. It was quite a poor game to be honest.
You always feel disappointment but I can’t ask any more from my players. They gave everything they could give.
If we score with a few minutes to go with PLAYER who maybe squares it to PLAYER, would I be asked the same question?
In a game of few chances, they took theirs when we could have had two or three opportunities to clear the ball in the last part. Of course a punishing schedule doesn't help but we grew in the game and we were better in the second half.
Of course it is tough on the players physically but we’re TEAM, we don't make excuses like that.
Going forward, we didn't use the ball well enough in the first half, that was our biggest problem. They locked us off to play down the right, we didn’t switch it enough, we didn't take care of the ball in the right ways. In the second half we had better control of the play and it was us more counter-attacking.
I don't think we need to make a massive story out of it, the problem is people are going to.

19,"It was a game we dominated, but you can’t give two goals so earlier in the game against top-level opponents. The first was a mistake in the first minute and the second was from a throw-in. TEAM had four entries into our box in the first half, we had 42 entries into the box.
As a team, we have to do better with that and we gave ourselves a lot to do as a result of it. TEAM changed their game plan, they sat a little bit deeper because of it, we dominated the ball, but it was our turn to be on the receiving end of big referee calls today in the box.
That happens and I want to say congratulations to TEAM. Their fans and their players put up a great fight and PLAYER produced world-class saves.
Granted there were two clear penalties in that spell. I just can’t see how the officials can’t give those. We had VAR in a cup final and to help our officials we have to have technology in our games. PLAYER said to me at the end, how did they not think it was a penalty.
To be fair, we have played at STADIUM and STADIUM and arguably TEAM could have had theirs [a penalty]. It is not about the impact it has on us, it is about across the board. We have to have technology.

4,"Good. Warm. Warmer I think than down the line. Hopefully it stays just as one time.
The moment the ball is over the top, you are not nervous, but the moment you see two players colliding into each other then you always wonder what the decision might be and in real life, I thought PLAYER could have made a different choice. But then I saw it back and I felt PLAYER just used his arm. For me, it wasn't a foul, but you never know refereeing decisions, do you?
PLAYER already had a good impact in the game at the weekend against TEAM, so it was good to see PLAYER is able to play 90 for PLAYER today and even score a goal. Started PLAYER off on the right, I felt PLAYER almost got a bit bored and didn't touch the ball a lot, so after 15-20 minutes we changed PLAYER’s [position] and were playing PLAYER in the midfield. We know PLAYER is a better midfielder than a winger, but we had to do it like this. So that was pleasing to see.
I think this club is known for this. I heard the fans singing for PLAYER, I don't know exactly what they sing, but it probably has to do with PLAYER coming from the Academy as well. We have already a few starters from our Academy and to see these players that train with us on a daily basis, we know their quality, so it's nice to see that they show [it] that they can easily play at this level.
The thing for them is, it's not about easily playing at this level, but you have to compete with PLAYER, PLAYER and all these kind of players. It's not enough to be good enough to play at this level, you have to be good enough to play for TEAM and that is probably the next step they have to make. But they've showed today that these players are capable of playing at a high level, that's for sure.
I don't know if we saw it the same, but I think what I saw is what you can expect. If a player is out for five or six months you cannot expect [too much]. I saw ups and downs. I saw some really good moments and I saw some moments where I felt like, 'OK, you can do better than this.' For me, that's completely normal if a player has been out for so long and plays their first game in five or six months.
I already said before that it makes it so difficult for me because normally in the pre-season a player gets three, four or five games especially and then PLAYER's only out for four or five weeks. Instead, PLAYER was out for so long, so to get PLAYER back to PLAYER’s best level is not easy, but it was good to see that PLAYER showed some quality already today. But it's the same for PLAYER like the youngsters, it's not enough to play at this level, you have to compete with PLAYER, PLAYER, PLAYER, PLAYER and PLAYER. But it's good to see that PLAYER's back and that PLAYER had a few good moments in the game.
It would be normal if I play with all the regular starters that we have a better team than we have tonight otherwise I make every week the wrong decision. Maybe it's a possibility! We also trust these players because we know how much quality they have. So, that's the first reason to play these players. We have a lot of confidence in them as well.
Second of all, it's not about the result on Sunday, it's more for the long-term fitness of the players that we made the decision that the ones who have played so many minutes to give them a bit of rest during this week, because the schedule is going to be intense again in the upcoming weeks. For the ones who have played a lot, only 45 or 60 minutes, and the ones who haven't played a lot play 90. That's what we did, and it was good for us that it was enough to win it.""",1.44,2,Strongly positive,5,5,0.6,0.64,0.6,1,1,0,61,18/12/2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,southampton,103,liverpool,64,southampton,103,st. mary's,0,1,2,0.38,2.36,0.38-2.36,2,1,1,2.36,0.38,1.98,-0.98,1,0,1,NA,NA
12,"Yes, of course I had doubts about that because before we scored it felt as if I was looking at the same game again and again and again and in the same pattern. I said it already a few times in other interviews that against TEAM everybody was focused on the PLAYER chance but [in] the seven minutes before we had three open chances. So many times in recent weeks – against TEAM as well – we missed a lot of chances, against TEAM we missed a lot. So, it would have been a bit surprising if I felt, 'OK, after all these chances missed today, we will probably score in the last five minutes.' But the players proved me wrong again.
[A reporter] asked me similar things before the game about PLAYER and I didn't agree then that PLAYER's not having a good season. I think PLAYER's having a good season, where PLAYER scores goals, works very hard for the team, assists. But PLAYER's in competition with a lot of good players, so that's why PLAYER's not every single game on the pitch. But I'm very happy with PLAYER – not only because PLAYER scored today but that, of course, helps – but I'm very happy with the other performances as well.
The first one was a long build-up, the second one was a counter-attack. PLAYER can, of course, score PLAYER’s goals against a low block because PLAYER's a striker and a threat in crosses as well. Immediately after PLAYER came on, PLAYER had quite a good chance when R PLAYER crossed it in. But if it's about strikers or if it's about the team, if we would not have scored today in the last five minutes then the headlines would have been different and no-one would have told you [about] 37 shots on [goal]. What a display. How many teams were able against TEAM to have 37 shots on [goal] during a game? And now because of us scoring two, there is probably a bit of emphasis on that fact as well.
So, this is the industry we work in. As a manager, the team, the players, we all accept this and we all understand that there is a lot of focus on if it doesn't go well and not as much on the fact if you have a great performance. We are in an industry where it's about winning and losing – and not about if you play beautiful football. People only enjoy good football, beautiful football if you win. And otherwise, there's no focus at all on the performance.
Again, you are talking about the result. I focus on my own team, so let's not focus on the teams we faced. But if you look at the amount of chances created and I think you are all a bit aware of xG, do me a favour and look back at our TEAM game and see what the xG of both teams was, and do this against TEAM and do this today. Then you will probably see that nothing has changed with us between now and the first half of the season.
What you do see is that at this moment of time it's harder for us to convert our chances into goals – that's not only up to us, that's also because teams throw themselves in front of every ball every time we get a chance, so many of the other teams try to prevent us from scoring because all of them are in a low block. So, I have a different opinion than you about our current performances but we have the same opinion about our results.
Because we are in an industry that's only talking about the results... as a manager I told the players during this week again I couldn't have asked for more in the TEAM game – only one counter-attack conceded and so many chances created against a team that hardly ever concedes any chance at all in their games. TEAM has never faced this season, I am 99.9 per cent sure, 37 shots in a game, so what can I ask more of our players?
I saw today TEAM were more of a threat on the counter-attack than TEAM were, let that be clear, but that has also to do with a lot of credit you have to give to TEAM because I saw their game on Tuesday where it was a completely equal game, both teams had numerous chances and they came back after 2-0 behind [against TEAM]. We knew how hard it was to play here, we knew how hard it is to play at TEAM and we knew how difficult it is to play against such a low block, as TEAM played against us and later on against TEAM. [The] second [half] of the season, [it] is always more difficult to win but I cannot ask for more from these players, they give everything they have.
A lot, that's clear, because I think today also you saw more than in the TEAM game… I think if I would have been the manager of TEAM I would have told you there were moments for us to win the game, because there were moments for them to win the game. Most of those moments were defended really well by PLAYER and PLAYER, they went in a one-v-one against them in a counter-attack, but we pushed them wide really well, which helped PLAYER to save those shots. I emphasised on that in the pre-match meeting, PLAYER likes it on PLAYER’s left and scores a lot by going inside. Of course, one of the reasons we're so high in the league table is because we have two and four very good centre-backs.
I was [delighted by PLAYER’s performance when PLAYER came on] and I'm happy we give you a chance to ask another question! All the other interviews, there was a lot of focus on PLAYER because PLAYER scored two goals and every time I said, 'Yeah, but don't forget PLAYER – PLAYER had a big impact on both goals as well.' It's so nice for me, for us as a team, that I have players that can impact the game on the bench as well. This happened at TEAM with PLAYER and PLAYER and today with PLAYER and with PLAYER.
If you only focus on results again, if you also focus on performance – which I do – I also liked PLAYER and PLAYER when they came in and PLAYER was only [on] for five minutes, so you can't say a lot about that. But it's nice to have so many opportunities on the bench, that's why they have to stay available, they have to stay fit, because one of the strengths of the team is not only four good centre-backs but definitely also players that can impact the game from the bench.",1.19375,2,Strongly positive,16,6,0.666666667,1.111111111,1.5,1,2,-0.833333333,58,18/01/2025,NA,22,sat,15:00 (16:00),2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,brentford,22,liverpool,64,brentford,22,gtech community,0,0,2,1.2,4.16,1.2-4.16,2,0,2,4.16,1.2,2.96,-0.96,1,0,1,17215,andy madley

I looked at the fourth official and said surely that will be checked. REFEREE said it can’t because it's a yellow card. The toughest thing to take is that there is nothing you can do when such a decision happens.
It’s already hard enough because they are a top team and when that’s taken out of your hands, it's such a tough one for the players.

We caused TEAM problems in terms of some great crossing chances that we think we really should have put in the net. But, again, we're creating the chances, so that's important for us.
The reaction after conceding the goal for us, for the whole group, I think was fantastic.
They gave it their all as well and credit to them, they stuck at it right to the end.
I thought the last 10-15 minutes were fantastic, I don't think either team wanted the game to end.
We actually worked on that in a week, so that’s nice to turn that over.

The last block was very intense as well. So I mean, it's not our best performance, but looking at putting it into perspective and looking at where we've come from, the most important thing we did that.

I'm very happy for PLAYER. PLAYER works really hard, but I want to give credit to the rest of the team as well because we all work really hard to set up good situations in front of goal.

117,"We were expecting a tough game against TEAM, who don't concede a lot of goals in the league and they have good defensive organisation, so it's good in terms of result, but we didn't play our best football.
In build-up phases and creation phases, we were not able to keep the ball and I would like my team to be able to hold the ball more than we did today. We created a lot of chances again but were not clinical or efficient enough.
When you don't do more in this type of game, you just leave the door a little bit open for the opposition. I think this is what happened today. But, we were able to finish, and a little bit of luck at the end when PLAYER hit the crossbar. We worked hard as a team to make sure the result.
In the build-up phases and creation phases, we were not patient enough.
Sometimes, we gave the ball away too much in this game. I don't want to find excuses, but the wind today was part of our performance. It's the worst element in football to have this windy weather. It didn't help, but it was the same for both teams, but, especially, when you have a team who wants to create and have possession of the ball.
We still need to progress. The good point is we are winning games and getting lots of points, but we can still make a lot of improvements, especially when we are in possession of the ball - being able to hold the ball under pressure.
This is something we have been working on and we want to work really hard to make sure for the next games that we will be able to do a better job.
I have the experience in being a player and now a manager. I worked in an environment before where the club had won a lot of titles, so I think one of my strengths is being able to observe and see how I need to manage my group and squad.
At TEAM, the players don't get overconfident. They just have the right mentality. They want to work hard. I'm happy with their mentality. If it's the case with some individuals, then I would talk to them and tell them how we achieve our goals.
PLAYER's able to play in different positions. PLAYER’s playing as a full-back on the left side is something really good because PLAYER's really technical.

13,"I am used to [it] from these players, what maybe today asked a bit more from them [is] that they had to be patient because the reason why TEAM has done so well - 21 games unbeaten and the teams they've beaten in the league - is, without any disrespect at all, they don't have the best players in the world, they have very good players, but they don't have the best players in the world and then to be able to do so well tells you how disciplined they are, how hard they want to work and how well the manager does over there.
We were not starting to force [anything] because they are really compact and defended really well. We didn't force a pass; we just kept the ball for as long as we could. The only thing I wasn't happy about is that not for the first time in recent weeks it was one chance for the other team and a goal, but that's maybe a phase of the season we are in at the moment.
Very pleased. Where I put everything down to first of all [is] the quality of the players, and second of all these quality players have an incredible work-rate. If you combine those two things, it's very difficult to score against the team. Apart from that, there were also games, I think when I look back at TEAM, for example, they created quite a few chances. PLAYER was fantastic back then. The nice thing for me is that we keep clean sheets not by defending a lot, we keep clean sheets by attacking a lot. That makes it even nicer than if we were all the time in a low block kicking every ball away and don't take any risks in build-up and then keep a clean sheet. It's still nice.

3,"I think it is exactly the opposite from the TEAM game, where I was pleased with the result but not with the performance. I was only pleased with the result. Now I am very, very, very happy about the performance [today]. I couldn't have asked for more, but of course not with the result that is definitely not what you expect or what you want. Being two times a goal down, so many things go against you except for one thing and that is our players and our fans, who were outstanding today.
I think what the team showed today, the character they showed, that's also what PLAYER showed. Sometimes if you get a kick like this, two studs on a knee, that can hurt for a few minutes. Then, if you just keep on running, it gets better and better and that's what we were hoping for. Not least because I only had one defender on the bench, who was not a left full-back as well. So, we were hoping PLAYER was managing to come through it and I think PLAYER did quite well, but the moment I noticed PLAYER wasn't completely themselves was the one time they put the ball in behind and PLAYER started running. PLAYER was just able to head it back to PLAYER, but I thought, 'OK, let's see how this continues' and I think it was quite quickly afterwards where PLAYER conceded the red card. Nothing to blame on PLAYER, [it was] character that PLAYER wanted to continue because PLAYER got quite a hard knock on PLAYER’s knee with two studs. Unfortunately it led to a red card that was a deserved red card.
Impressed, like everyone who was in the stadium or saw the game. PLAYER did outstanding again today. Without the ball, PLAYER was mostly in our last line, had to play sometimes against a nine, against wingers who are really fast. And with the ball, he came into the midfield. An outstanding performance. But if we only highlight PLAYER, I don't think I give enough credit to all the other ones that played next to PLAYER and around PLAYER. I couldn't have asked for more. Dominated the game, more ball possession with 10 PLAYERS, more chances created – everything what you want. Unfortunately for us, maybe the only chance they got with [us having] 10 PLAYERS led to a goal – that sometimes happens as well.
No, because you never know which player is going to go out and which team you've lined up. It always depends on the players you have available, how you are going to react to that. Are you one goal down, are you one goal up? So, that makes a difference. If you are one goal up, you might consider to defend with a lot of players, so then I might have considered to bring immediately a defender in. But if you are one goal down, you see differently. So first you take a look at the tactic board and you think, 'This might be a good option.' That's what we did for five minutes. But then looking at it, it looked better on a tactic board than on the pitch with PLAYER being a left-back!
So, we changed that after five minutes and our message cut across I think even better at half-time, where you can tell them even more clearer what we expect from them. And then it helps if you immediately score the 1-1. What doesn't help – we had great momentum – [was] that the game was again delayed for three, four or five minutes immediately after we scored the goal because they were on the ground and that happened a bit too much for us to keep the momentum going. Everybody is saying, 'Yeah, you've played quite a lot of time.' That's true, but the momentum is then like this if every time there's a treatment for an injury.
First of all, we are delighted to have some players back because we've had our injuries. The good thing is that nobody spoke about it because that means you get results. But to have them available at this moment of time was really helpful. There are two journalists over here, so they were not surprised by the substitutions I made and maybe you as well weren't. We just thought [to] bring all the players in that can score a goal. And then to see them working so hard without the ball... so we had five or six players who were mainly offensive players but with 10 to keep the other team away from goal and still create chances was great to see. And, indeed, PLAYER and PLAYER had an impact but PLAYER had an impact as well, being out for two months now – it's good to have PLAYER back also.""",0.835714286,2,Strongly positive,14,4,1.75,0.375,0.5,2,-1,1.25,45,14/12/2024,NA,16,sat,15:00 (16:00),2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,liverpool,64,fulham,45,fulham,45,anfield,1,2,2,2.1,1.29,2.1-1.29,2,2,0,2.1,1.29,0.81,-0.81,0,1,1,60333,tony harrington
99,"Yes definitely, I’m very happy with the performance and the way the team wanted to attack the game, we really do, we really showed that on the pitch. Sometimes it's easy to have words and plans but then actually putting it into action. I think we did really, really well today, so I’m happy about the performance, there are always things we can do better. I think we dominated big parts of the game, especially the start of the second half, we had strong momentum. 
Obviously, when you have momentum over such a big period of time against tough opposition, it would be really good to continue because you always know you’re going to get a chance or two and that’s what they did, they brought on some players, they were good at set pieces as well.
We’re obviously going to review and make sure that’s part of the training week ahead of the next game, so that’s all we can do. I know the players are very motivated.
That’s an area of our game that we’ve said we can develop and that’s part of the plan for the block and it was part of the plan for this game to be ruthless in the box and I think we did that really well, defending our box.",1.5,2,Strongly positive,2,6,1.933333333,0.111111111,1.583333333,1.6,1.5,0.35,6,03/11/2024,NA,6,sun,12:30 (13:30),2024/2025,renÃ£Â©e slegers,7,arsenal,5,manchester utd,70,arsenal,5,manchester utd,70,leigh sports village,0,1,1,1.1,1.9,1.1-1.9,1,1,0,1.9,1.1,0.8,-0.8,0,0,0,8348,kirsty dowle
29,"Yes, there is some frustration, especially for the way we conceded the goal at the end, it’s a bad feeling.
I think the first 15 or 20 minutes of the second half was the part I didn’t like, because we conceded too many transitions and we knew they are a team building from transitions, with PLAYER, PLAYER, PLAYER and PLAYER.
In the first half I felt we controlled that very good, we scored and created chances, then in the second half I think we gave them too much energy in the first 15 or 20 minutes. Even when they’d equalised we had some good chances, with PLAYER and PLAYER, but it was a shame.
For sure we can manage the game better because, as I said, we knew that they are very good in transition, it is difficult to find a team like them with so many players that can run a lot. I think in the first half we controlled that well. In the first 15 or 20 minutes of the second half, we didn’t control that.
It’s a game that for me, before you attack you need to give passes, passes, passes, because that makes us close together, and in the moment that we lose the ball we can be aggressive. But if we want to attack with one or two passes, then we are stretched, we are open, and they can hurt us. But it’s a lesson that we can learn.
TEAM are a team that if you want to attack quick, then they will attack quick, and it becomes a basketball game. That’s not for us, we need to control it better.
If there was something I didn’t like, for sure it was the result, but the other thing is that at some moments we could manage the game much better.

That's why we have to say first of all sorry for our fans. We are very disappointed today and we have to use these hard moments to push forward and to look forward to the next challenge.
We know that, even if you are showing control [in the early part of the match], you have to avoid the counter-attack, you have to defend the crosses better.
We had a very clear chance to match before the red card. 
It was a key minute because we were not able to equalise and then straight away it’s a red card. Before the half-time break we were thinking about any changes and looking forward to the second half.
At the start of the second half we were able to have three or four corners, waiting for our moment to level the match. 
We can and we have to do much better. 
You can prepare the team but the players have to take the right decisions and we have to play with eleven men. 
It's one of the situations we can avoid because there was no danger of this. We had a lot of players in our box.
It is a big advantage for the opponent above all because there is a lot of time in front of you. It was a bad moment for us and a very good moment for them because they wanted to damage us on the counter-attack.
That's why in the second half we tried to wait a moment.. I repeat that today is a hard night for us.
We have to look forward to the next challenge against TEAM and try to use this moment to remind us and push us up. 
Hopefully we can get everybody back together and regroup. I think that we need to have this kind of environment against TEAM at home. It's going to be hard but for sure it's going to be important for us.
We have to be ready to prepare for this match this week and to think that there are a lot of points in front of us. But if we want to achieve good things we have to compete better. We have to be more consistent.

107,"Yeah, when you have this kind of moments, especially in the big clubs, it’s really hard to turn things around, especially when you don’t have a lot of time to train the basics to cope with the difficult moments. We have to acknowledge our position, the way you see the league, everybody can win [against] everybody. So we have to win games and to focus on surviving.
PLAYER wants to be [there] and then PLAYER returns in the second half. It was a very difficult moment and PLAYER’s a human being, but then PLAYER felt the support of the fans in the end, so everything is okay.
It’s really hard, I think it’s really hard on everybody and you feel it on the pitch. I think we show some improvements in the first games, especially against TEAM and TEAM, even in TEAM the first moment, but we are losing that because of the lack of training and the lack of belief after so many losses. Some difficult moments when you suffer some goals in the beginning of the games and then it’s really hard during all the games. So it’s a really tough moment for everybody and I think the players losing everything, the small things that we try to work on in training, after one goal, they lose everything because they don’t have the base, we don’t have time to build the base to cope with the difficult moments. So it’s really hard in this moment.
Yeah, it’s also my fault in this moment because I think the team know it’s not improved. I think it’s a little bit lost in this moment, so it’s a little bit embarrassing to be TEAM coach and to lose a lot of games. But we have to cope with that, difficult moments in the life of everybody. So it’s a hard moment.
It’s like playing with three it's, more or less, the same thing of playing with four. We can change the characteristics, if you play with PLAYER on the wing, it could be a little bit different. We have some games that we press in 4-4-2. So I don’t see it that way. Of course, the players are not… I didn’t choose the players specifically for that position, but that I already knew, but I have to sell my idea, if I’m going to change all the time, it’s going to be even worse. But I understand that they have a lot of difficulties because they spend two years playing one way and then they are playing another. And with a lot of losses, it’s really tough on them and you can feel it during the games. Even today, when we try to score and we are near to score, it’s more from them than the organisation. You can feel it, I can feel it. But I have to sell my idea, I don’t have another one.
If I change the system completely, I don’t know if I’m near to win. If I do that and continue to lose, then it’s worst. You don’t know, I don’t know, and I see the game in a different way. It doesn’t matter if you are three, with five, or with four. If you know the basics and if you can train that idea, I see the game in this way. So I understand what you’re saying but if I know, for sure, that changing everything is going to get us near to win games, I will do it.
When you have a change of coach, especially in this type of club, it’s because they are not winning and they play specifically in the system they were bought for and choose perfectly for that system. So, in that moment, with the idea with two years working in pre-seasons, they were losing. So I’m going to change for that system that I don’t believe to change things to win games? It doesn’t make sense. So I can understand your ideas. For me, it’s more simple than that. What I think is that, of course, if I think the players with right profile for each position, it will be different, but I have to start now this moment because this team was already in problems. So I have to teach what I know and that is my focus and I believe in that.
We don’t have that possibility, if we don’t take [sell]] some players. So you know the situation better than I am. So it’s not the case that I am arriving here and I can spend a lot of money changing all the team. You know the situation, so it’s not a point to talk about it.
I think about the team, you think a lot about PLAYER. I think about the team. I am not making a point, I just want to win the games. And you can feel it, I am talking about the idea and the fight for relegation. I want to make a point during the game? No, I just want to win the game.
I am responsible, I don’t like to arrive here and make excuses. I think people are tired of excuses in this club. Sometimes, I talk about relegation because of that. I think our club needs a shock, it needs a shock, and we have to understand that. It’s a very difficult moment and we have to fight for the next game and to implement the idea to win games and also to have the performance, because I think we are losing some things from the last games.
I just want to win games. I never watch a coach winning games by not protecting the players. So what I have to say to the players, I say in the dressing room.

60,"Disappointed with the result because I think we deserved more and at the same time very proud of the team, the way we played here against this opponent, in this stadium, they have battered every opponent here and obviously it wasn’t the case today. But after doing the most difficult thing, very disappointed, nowhere near the standards, our defensive habits, the moment you allow that space and time to any of their players with the quality they have you’re going to get punished, so that’s not bad luck. 
But in the end, the team showed its teeth, how much they wanted it, they took risks, full determination, put TEAM under every problem. We were very aggressive.
I don’t know any other player in the league that is capable of doing that after six weeks out, PLAYER had a day and a half, a training and a half. Just physically and mentally to be connected the way PLAYER was with the team is unbelievable.
That is not very much like us but I think today on that sense we have to fault ourselves and that’s something that we certainly have to do better.
There is nothing we can change today about that. What I am just praying is that after the international break I have the team fully equipped physically, they are available and they are fit because it has been an absolute nightmare for eight weeks. Issue after issue, not only the ones that are not able to play, but the ones that are able to play only for certain moments, only for certain days, not able to train. So I’m just asking that because the team, the desire that they have and how much we want it, there’s no question about that. So, it’s going to come, we just need that on our side to be able to be more consistent.
Today was about winning and how you perform and against TEAM we were much better than them, 100%, I’ve watched it back twice and I'm more convinced about that. Today I think we deserved more but this is football, the margins are so small so you cannot give anything to the opponent.
It doesn’t look good because two players of that importance tell you that they cannot continue in the game, so it obviously isn’t good news.
Win, win and win because these guys, they don’t stop winning, so that’s what we have to do.
When it gets nasty, show your teeth and show how much you want it. When it’s Disneyland, it’s easy, everyone is next to you and telling you how beautiful you are and when it gets dark and difficult, everyone is questioning it. That’s when I want to see people, that’s when I’m always looking around, who’s going to step in that role, yes or no.
Well we don’t put the chances away and some other times, we haven’t had that determination inside the box to make it happen. We are just hoping that it’s going to happen, which is something that’s very different in football. Certainly, the team is in the right direction, that team doesn’t do that because I haven’t seen any team against TEAM do what we’ve done today here.",0.3625,1,Mildly positive,8,6,-1.333333333,0.666666667,-0.5,-2,-1,-0.833333333,27,10/11/2024,NA,11,sun,16:30 (17:30),2024/2025,mikel arteta,3,arsenal,6,chelsea,33,arsenal,6,chelsea,33,stamford bridge,0,1,1,1.24,1.96,1.24-1.96,1,1,0,1.96,1.24,0.72,-0.72,0,1,1,39780,michael oliver
1,"I've said many times already to the other media there were moments in the game where you thought if we could come away from here with a draw it would be a good result, but those moments were mainly in the first half. In the second half, especially after we scored for 1-1, I thought we were really impressive. We created so many opportunities, good chances. Then [the result] feels like a disappointment.
I think PLAYER had a massive impact on the game as well. PLAYER came in really well, PLAYER also, but I think in general in the second half we played much, much better than the first half. In the first half we had a lot of problems with their intensity, aggressive playing style without the ball – aggressive in a good way. We tried to cope with it, but every time we touched them we got a yellow and that doesn't really help for us to be intense then as well. But we give credit to them, they were more intense than us. They forced us into too many mistakes. It wasn't that difficult for us to be better in the second half with the ball and that's what we were. Maybe it was difficult for them to keep the intensity of the first 45 minutes going and as a result of that, or of all of these things, we dominated the second half.
It is difficult for me to predict the long-term future, the only thing I can expect or predict is he is in a very good place at the moment. PLAYER plays in a very good team that provides him with good opportunities and then he is able to do special things. What makes PLAYER even more special for me is before we scored for 1-1 you thought, ' PLAYER is not playing his best game today,' but then to come up with a half-hour with an assist, two goals, having a shot against the bar and being a constant threat, that is something not many players can do if they've played the first hour like PLAYER did. So, that is also what makes PLAYER special, apart from if you just look at the goals. PLAYER’s finishing is so clinical. A special player, but that's what we all know.
I have seen many games of last season but it is always difficult to judge a player if you are not there. What I did most was [look at] style of play and team performance and not that much the individual performance and what I noticed from the start, when PLAYER came in [in pre-season was] how fit PLAYER was, how ready PLAYER was to make it a very good season. That PLAYER led by example from the first day onwards in pre-season where so many of PLAYER’s teammates who PLAYER usually plays with, so the international players, were not there and to still be able to work that hard, PLAYER did, and train so hard: yeah, and then we all saw the quality in the training sessions. So it's not a surprising thing for me that PLAYER has done so well until now.
PLAYER was already out before we played TEAM and TEAM, PLAYER was out before we played TEAM and PLAYER didn't play TEAM as well and we kept a clean sheet two times against the best teams that have dominated Europe for so long. To go away to TEAM is such a difficult game to play and they have so much quality, throughout the whole squad but especially up front as well.

But, if you analyse the performance, it was a tough game. We didn't control everything in the game.
It's never easy for them to not start the game, especially in a derby. They have a lot of quality, but this is where sometimes as a manager you have headaches, but my job is to make decisions.
They have the right mentality, even if they are frustrated not to start the game. Coming in, they had a big impact, which is a really good thing for me and my squad.
PLAYER is a player who is really creative with the ball. I don't need to teach PLAYER anything - PLAYER already knows.
When you have these tight games, PLAYER can make the difference. Small details are really important. Maybe, having PLAYER available today can make the difference.

This is the first match at home, so I think that we have to highlight above all the reaction of the team after a very bad start. It was a nightmare to start losing in the first minute.
We knew that [they would start fast] as we showed them images of the two goals that they had scored [in the first minute against TEAM and TEAM in their previous two matches], but sometimes, despite you doing that, it can happen and it was a bad surprise for us.
But after we were into the match, we balanced the match in the first half and in the second half, in my opinion, we were better than them. We deserved to win, had a lot of situations to do better in the last pass, in the last cross, when we had a very clear situation.
We were able to change the match against a very good team at home, so we have to highlight this, to keep the good, positive things. We are with one win very close with a lot of teams, a lot of big teams, so I think that I have tried to highlight the positive things and to highlight the positive reaction in the second half when we worked as a team, and it is very important for us.
We talked about this (starting the second half on the front foot) and we showed this character and this personality.
I was thinking ‘what do we have to do to score?’ because we had a lot of situations. I was thinking to win the match and we made the changes thinking this.
I repeat, I think that there was one good reaction and one good behaviour in the second half. I think that's the first step to build good things.
I think that the supporters knew the difficulties to play here, and they knew the difficulties to suffer [conceding] one goal in the first minute.
It's not easy for any team and that's why I think that we feel their support in all the match and I’m happy for them, but I prefer to keep the good things and to look forward for the next challenge.
PLAYER scored his goal and he was, as always, working for the team.
I think that we need this kind of behaviour in the big matches, because this is the league.
In the league you have to play always with eleven players fighting for the team, having this kind of a high work-rate.

28,"I’m absolutely happy. I just said to the players I’m more happy today than the TEAM game. The reason why is I was quite worried about this game. It’s a tricky game, a tricky stadium, a tricky team.
They are defensively top. They are one of the five best teams in Europe in terms of clean sheets. You struggle to create chances against them. It was not an easy game.
You have to deal with and learn to play different games: long balls, second balls, channels, set-pieces. Football is not only how good we play on the ball. It’s also how you defend and how you deal with that. I’m very proud today.
In general, you always struggle to create chances against them. We knew it would be a tough game in terms of clear chances. For sure, we could have attacked better, but there was not space for PLAYER. In the last half-hour, we tried to move PLAYER into an attacking midfielder, with PLAYER next to PLAYER to change something.
Overall in this type of game, knowing you are not going to create many chances, you have to be clinical. First half, PLAYER had a one-v-one with the keeper, hit the post, and we had another two or three chances inside the box.
If you are able to be clinical there and score, probably the game becomes different, but until that moment you’re going to struggle.

67,"I haven’t seen it enough. There was one angle that looked like it [hit his arm], the decision is made, that’s it. Incredibly proud of the team, I think it was an immense performance, immense. Against this team, what they’ve done, after playing three times in six days, with the same players, not having enough to change it, I cannot be prouder of that. Then, very disappointed with the result, obviously, we can fault ourselves as well because defending the way we did, it cannot be part of our game if we want to be at the highest level in this country because the rest is, what else can I ask the team to do against a really good side.
I think every situation is very different. As well we have come back from situations more than probably before as well. Today, you have to give credit to the opposition, PLAYER puts in an unbelievable ball, and PLAYER arrives in there. What the game showed and how we performed, the scoreline and reflection is nowhere near.
Yes, for sure, especially with the numbers we have in the squad and looking at our bench. Very worried.
Yeah, there are moments obviously, they managed to do that. I mean, the subs made the impact and the other team managed to change the game. And on our side, the danger was because I knew half the team was, that we could go downhill because we were physically drained. Suddenly, the team found another gear to go again and just put TEAM in their box and go and go again, trying to find the goal that we haven’t been able to score at the end. 
I’m not happy, I cannot talk about the rest, but about the difference between the two teams, I think that was very obvious.

16,"I was invested in the performance, I was more interested in that than I was anything else, because I felt at the STADIUM we really let ourselves down with the basics.
We started this game the better, we were aggressive, particularly with our first and second balls.
We haven’t got a striker, I had to play PLAYER, who has been sick all week, up top and ask PLAYER to do a job for the team and PLAYER's had a tremendous game. But this isn't about PLAYER, it’s about the whole team and everything they did. PLAYER sometimes had a tough time against PLAYER before but PLAYER was really outstanding. The better team won.
It is a playground for PLAYER out there, PLAYER is a maverick, not always perfect, not always consistent, but I understand that person and I know when we get to STADIUM, PLAYER will 1,000 per cent perform for the team here.
PLAYER had been sick all week. PLAYER came on against TEAM last week and PLAYER wasn't very well. This week PLAYER came out for one training session I said look, you've got a go up top, we don’t have another striker, and I thought PLAYER played with joy, PLAYER played with freedom when the ball came to PLAYER’s feet, and PLAYER can carry the weight of the crowd.
PLAYER knows PLAYER's an important player to the team and PLAYER put in a shift again out of possession and the players behind really appreciate that when it happens.
I just love there being a big crowd, I really do, I love seeing their away section and the rivalries that come with that. And then the rest of the stadium - there was a noise to it. There's an atmosphere. It was fun to see.
Everybody says TEAM don't want to play big teams here but that is not the case. I love STADIUM but I've always wanted to pack STADIUM.

But I think that despite this, I was not happy with the first half because we can't [give a] gift to the opponent for 45 minutes. Okay, we defended well but it was not enough. That's why I was not happy with the first half.
Not because they they had a chance. No, because I think that we didn't show the energy and the character that we needed. 
We did well in the second half we did, but we have to be more consistent. 
The personality and the energy of the team has to there be from the start of the match and we didn't make the right decisions about our distances to be more aggressive in the press.
We were late [in the press] so I was not happy with this, but I think in the second half we did very well. It was not enough, but we can look at a positive thing - the chances that we had.
It was always our intention to play as we did in the second half from the start. That's how we work. 
Okay, it's true that we don't have [some of our players] right now. Four players, important players, were out. But despite this, I think that the team showed in the second half that there is an opportunity for the other players too and that they took advantage of this opportunity.
It was a pity. But okay, we are looking forward to the next challenge.

31,"Probably we did enough to win the game today, between the first half and the second half I think we created enough chances to win the game, but going forward you need to be clinical, otherwise the game is always open, especially in this stadium.
Any transition, any corner, brought energy for them. Unfortunately at the end we conceded but overall today I think we did enough to win.
For me it’s not about the table, it’s just about seeing how we can improve things and today for me the performance was very good, on the ball and off the ball. But this moment of the season is going to happen for any team in any season.
Every game is different, sometimes it is for one reason, other times a different reason. Today if I have to decide the reason for the result, I think it is just about trying to be clinical when you have the chance to kill the game.
If you continue to be open at the end, you are going to concede some transitions, some corners, and then you can concede a goal.
First of all I’ve always said the most important thing is to create chances, because if you create chances that means you are doing the right things. Then you need to take those chances.
In the TEAM game, we had so many chances. Sometimes that’s football. Sometimes you create one chance and score one, sometimes you need to create 10 chances to score two.
The only thing we can do is try to be even more intense during the week when we prepare for the game, even if the intensity of the players is already top, but for sure it is something that we need to improve, remembering that we are one of the best teams for scoring goals at this moment.",0.7,2,Strongly positive,16,2,0,0,0.5,0,0,-0.5,9,04/01/2025,NA,20,sat,15:00 (16:00),2024/2025,enzo maresca,6,chelsea,33,crystal palace,36,chelsea,33,crystal palace,36,selhurst park,0,1,1,1.28,1.52,1.28-1.52,1,1,0,1.52,1.28,0.24,-0.24,0,1,1,25179,tim robinson

We started very well, but suffered a very early equalising goal. I think after that we had a very good mentality, we kept strong and we deserved to score.
In the last chance of the half we did, and we kept going in the second half. We kept looking for goals and in the end we achieved the result.
It is always a good moment to score a goal!
But it’s true that we deserved to score before we did, in the last action of the first half.
I would like to highlight the defensive work we did, too.
Against this kind of team, the key thing is that we defend very well and we don’t allow them to play us in their style. I think that was important.
PLAYER did well and we are happy for him.
There is good competition between him, PLAYER and PLAYER. They are always ready and push one another on, so this is good.

83,"Overall, we showed character and resilience as a team to keep going until the end, showing that never-say-die attitude that we've talked about over the last couple of weeks. 
Could we have started faster? That's something we were disappointed with at half time if I'm honest. I thought that we could have been a little bit more aggressive in our press, which is why we changed the structure at half time. 
That enabled us to grow into the game a lot more, and I thought that our finishers did a really excellent job again today. 
The change at the break allowed us to be more positive on the front foot
The more you work with players, the more you see their capabilities and when it's down to them in terms of using their strengths to get back into the game. 
There was a moment where I thought the game suited certain people to come onto the pitch and change things. I also felt that the front three weren't able to press as high as I wanted them to. We just weren't able to be effective higher up the pitch, and the change in shape allowed us to do so. 
The momentum shifted in our favour towards the end of the game and we showed huge amounts of character, which is what we're about. 
We're definitely making progress, and we've shown that 
It's been a lot of change and there's a lot of changes in the way that we're trying to play, operate and generally do things. 
We're learning every single game to move ourselves forward in a way that's going to be successful for the long term. 
There's a long way to go still, but when we reflect on the games that we've had, you can see the progression that's being made. 
Consistency is the key in the next block of games, the way we start games, the way we finish games. There's still parts that we're not quite there with, but we're certainly working towards that. 
The international break presents opportunities for us to work on certain things
It's an opportunity to fine tune people's roles and responsibilities. We can work on anything that an individual player needs to brush up on, whether that be strengths or weaknesses. 
We've got a couple of players who are close to being available for selection, so that's going to help strengthen the squad after the international break.

And today we have to play in a really special place. Our history wasn't very optimistic about what could happen, but we found a way, and that says about how much the team wants it.
When you are there and you really want it, and I felt the team was in a really good space before the game. We started the game well, I think it touched something, especially with the duties and the things that we have to do in both possessions. And we started to play too safe, not respecting any structure and knowing our purpose, and I didn't like it. I would have to change that, and when we wanted to change it, we struggled to do it. But if you don't have that element of the game to be more dominant and be more present in the game, you have to be extraordinary at competing and doing the defensive things right, And after all that, we were excellent.
My experience in this league is that any team can beat any team. And I lived it in various scenarios on the last day when a lot of teams had necessities, although not much, and the honesty and respect that everybody puts in the games is phenomenal. We know we need a result, we need to do our own thing still in the last game but today we want to really knock that door and open that box of dreams to leave the last and the final day of the season in front of our people with the opportunity to win the league. And that's something that we're going to do together. And I'm so pleased that we're going to be with these players and staff.

Today, it was not about maybe showing the best performance and we prepared the players for being ready for a big fight – and it was a big fight. We took this fight, and we knew that when we are stable in defending, we will create our situations, we will get our moments, and so it happened.
It's a big credit to the players, how they played today, and really thank you to all our supporters.
I was really surprised; half of the stand was full of TEAM fans, and this on a weekday evening, cold temperatures here in an away game, so thanks for this big support again, and a very, very nice evening for all of us!
We know that we can create the situations. I think, like always, if we are a little bit more clinical in the final pass we could create more, but overall, we had big chances.
Then, we had the momentum on our side, and we had more chances to decide the game, and we missed them, and then TEAM is like every team: you try everything, a set-play, long balls, and everything can happen, and once we needed the post, so we were lucky in this situation.
But overall it was a very, very positive performance, and especially the result.
It was great. We won the ball, and then passed to PLAYER, and then also PLAYER passed, it was one touch from PLAYER, and it was the second touch in space.
And then also, the second big chance, it was a fantastic ball and pass from PLAYER – so we know that these players can always decide a game, but to be that stable in defending is also a big part that they contribute in this defending.
It's not that they are off when the opposite team has the ball, so we were a great unit again, a great unit within the players, a great unit within the team, and a great unit together with our fans.

They started better than us and put us under pressure early on in the game, but when we managed to find our feet a little bit and got a bit more aggressive on the press, something we spoke about at half-time, we started the second half much brighter.
On the balance of play, we had multiple chances and we’re a bit disappointed. I think PLAYER has made a fantastic save to keep one of the shots out from PLAYER, so you have to give her credit for that as well. The point is important.
We showed character and resilience.
We were definitely more positive to take the chances on [in the second-half]. I just don’t think we really believed in it with some of the chances we had, and we probably could have been a bit more ruthless, but the way we moved the ball caused them a lot of problems. Most of the momentum in the second half was in our favour, apart from a little spell towards the end of the game.
I think it’s important when you get to that stage that you show the character and resilience to see it out, still play with composure.
I think everyone put their bodies on the line and PLAYER said straight away in the huddle at the end of the game that everyone’s attitude and desire in and around the box is probably one of the best it has been in games.

If you don’t go person to person against this team, you struggle to recover the ball. After then, we adjusted that and the game was much better. It completely changed.

To the fans, the message is that you are right that football is important. But there are times that is important to be together as a family. I wish all the best to all of our supporters.

93,"We started much better than we did last week. I obviously wanted a response from the players this week, and we definitely got that. The way that we played was much more positive in terms of our attacking football in particular, we created some really good chances in the first half, and we were a bit disappointed not to be in front at half time.
As the game evolved, naturally, it ebbed and flowed a little bit, and we had to absorb a bit of pressure in the second half. Given the momentum that they had was at different times, but the response was really positive from the players, and we've made sure that we've kept going all the way to the end and showed that character and resilience.
In the first half I think we should have been ahead in the game.
I made some changes and wanted to make sure we got something out of the game.
We were getting a lot of success in wide areas, and I felt like PLAYER could potentially be a bit of a threat in the air and in and around the box. 
I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t frustrated about the result.
Given the nature of the game and the way that we’ve played the game, I think we deserved a different result.
I think the quality that we had on the ball and our defensive organisation caused them a lot of problems and minimised their clinical chances significantly. When you look at the balance of it, it’s a significant improvement on how we played last week.
We delivered the gameplan today and we created opportunities, and that’s a positive we have to take.

We want to give our fans a good finish to the season at home, so that’s our aim for next week.",0.342857143,1,Mildly positive,7,9,0.4,0.8,-0.011111111,1,1,0.411111111,103,28/04/2024,NA,20,sun,14:00 (15:00),2023/2024,rehanne skinner,2,west ham,116,aston villa,8,west ham,116,aston villa,8,villa park,0,1,1,1,0.8,1.0-0.8,1,1,0,0.8,1,-0.2,0.2,0,1,0,4282,emily heaslip
94,"We started the match positively, which it is something we’ve not done enough of this season. I thought we started the game brilliantly, had some great chances in the first half. I think it was great early because I don’t think we have done that enough this season. We did last week, and have done it again this week, so we just want to keep building on that and get more consistency. 
In the second half, I thought we just let them have too much of the ball, time and space for parts of it and they had some good chances. There were some good chances on the counter-attack in particular. 
I think over the course of the season, PLAYER has been brilliant for us. It has taken us a little bit of time to get used to the quality of her movement and finding PLAYER’s feet a little bit more, but as time has gone on, PLAYER has cemented PLAYER place in the team and has been really effective for us, especially in possession and building the attack. PLAYER works incredibly hard as well and has done that all season for themselves, the team and the fans. 
I think we have been getting better at the end of games all of the time, and for the last 15 minutes we threw everything at it again. The subs came on and tried to impact the game and the energy changed a little. 
We had a couple of chances, but I think a large chunk of the second half was in their favour and PLAYER made a couple of fantastic saves at that point. In terms of clear-cut chances it was fairly even. 
I think PLAYER has just continued to improve, and over recent years PLAYER has just got better and better. For the rest of the season PLAYER has been really consistent. PLAYER has been superb for us, and has taken on leadership responsibilities as well for the team. I think PLAYER has stood up to that really well. Ultimately, you can see the quality PLAYER has, PLAYER makes big saves at key moments and I think PLAYER has done that again today. 
The fans have been fantastic. I’m just delighted with the way the fanbase has grown over the course of the season, and now we are creating an atmosphere here all the time. I’m really grateful for their [the fans’] support as it has made a difference. If you look at our performances here, at the points we have taken and the points we have almost taken, it shows our home performances have significantly improved and that coincides with having more fans, more atmosphere and more support.",1.266666667,2,Strongly positive,9,3,1.333333333,0.444444444,1.666666667,2,2,-0.333333333,14,05/05/2024,NA,21,sun,15:00 (16:00),2023/2024,rehanne skinner,2,west ham,116,west ham,116,leicester,57,leicester,57,chigwell construction,1,1,1,0.7,0.9,0.7-0.9,1,1,0,0.7,0.9,-0.2,0.2,0,1,0,1846,abigail byrne
2,"If you ask me about all the six games, I'm really pleased with all the results, I am really pleased with the five [other] games with the way we played. I'm far from pleased about the performance tonight.
A lot, but especially two things. If you play against a team that has such a good idea about football, knows how to bring the ball out from the back – like some other teams we faced recently, like TEAM or TEAM – then you need to be so intense if you want to make it difficult for them. But if every time you are waiting a few seconds before you press, and if you do press you are so easily outplayed, then this team can cause you a lot of problems. That's what they've shown throughout the whole campaign, except for [against] TEAM away.
I almost feel sorry for them because they deserved so much more in this campaign. But we have an incredible goalkeeper. The other part was every time we lost the ball we were not aggressive enough, so every time we lost the ball they could almost every time go all the way to our goal, having a shot or a blocked shot, and then we could attack again. Hardly any control at all over the game; maybe the second half was a bit better, but then I am trying to be positive.
Maybe the first five or 10 minutes they went on the counter-attack one or two times still. Like so many times this season, if a team plays us they do something different than they do [in] all the other games. We might see this as a compliment for what we've done until now and the quality of our players. But they played without a nine, a bit similar like TEAM. So, it wasn't always easy for us to press them well. But I don't think it had that much to do with tactics, because if it's only tactics in terms of how you have to defend then it's when they have the ball, when they bring the ball out from the back. But if we lose the ball and they could also go all the way to our goal, that tells me that in general we were by far not aggressive enough without the ball. Maybe the goal helped us most, that we scored a goal from a penalty.
What I can agree on is that PLAYER missed a few chances. Then it's always the question: does this have anything to do with low confidence or is this a situation where PLAYER is in at the moment? I think every striker all around the world has periods where every ball goes in, and sometimes PLAYER has a period where you try so hard but you're not able to score. The good thing is that we have many players that can score for us – today PLAYER again. I would have loved to see PLAYER score because I think every striker wants to score [and] needs goals – that's why I kept PLAYER in for quite a long time. PLAYER was a threat but unfortunately PLAYER couldn't score. Yes, PLAYER made a lot of saves, but I think if you make highlights of this game we will all see a few chances that we had as well, which is normal. What is not normal is that we concede so many chances.
No, PLAYER definitely didn't. I said a bit of a joke that maybe the players wanted to see how fit PLAYER really was, so to give PLAYER so much work. But, of course, that was not our plan. PLAYER showed again today why I said so many times that PLAYER is our first goalkeeper. That has nothing to do with PLAYER – PLAYER did so, so well. But PLAYER has been so important for this club for so many years, for PLAYER’s country as well. PLAYER showed today that PLAYER is probably one of the best, in my opinion the best goalkeeper in the world. And let's hope PLAYER can keep continuing to bring these performances. Let's hope even more that PLAYER can stay fit.""",0.342857143,1,Mildly positive,7,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,31,10/12/2024,league phase,6,tue,0.78125,2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,girona,48,liverpool,64,girona,48,estadi montilivi,0,0,1,1.23,2,1.23-2.00,1,0,1,2,1.23,0.77,0.23,1,0,1,9241,benoÃ®t bastien
35,"We knew that TEAM are one of the biggest tests in the world, but it was a pity that above all, at the start of the match, in the second half and at the end of the first, too, we had our good moments.
I think we did really well in the half of the second half, but we didn’t score and when you don’t score against these kinds of teams, they don’t forgive.
It’s true that we did little mistakes and against these kinds of teams in these kinds of matches, you can’t concede these kind of chances, because they don’t forgive.
It was a pity because the players and the team made a big effort today after playing three days in a very tough match against TEAM.
We were very close and I think we deserved it in the second half above all, but we didn’t and we have to keep the good things and try to improve the other things.
I have to see the match again, but I had the feeling from the bench in the second half, thinking that we were better and we had the control.
We had long possession and we were able to show we are not only a counter-attacking team. We dominated a big team, but for all this, you cannot take advantage of all these things if you don’t score.
We didn’t score and that’s why we keep the good things and try to improve the others.
First of all, TEAM have big, big quality in their individual players and secondly they have big, big quality as a team, so they are dual difficulties, and they play always with one idea.
We tried to avoid a lot of things and I think that sometimes we did, but I think, we could do better. We conceded these actions and their kind of players don’t forgive.
We have to improve in these things, for sure.

62,"I didn’t know that, but that tells you how crazy it was, how efficient both teams were in front of the goal. It was a spectacular 30 minutes. Straight away, how much the team wanted it, the purpose, the determination, the quality that we deliver. But then after that, we had a period where the individual quality of them play a big part. Then it’s game on, you can sense the energy change and then what’s next. For the second half, we could play a very different game, that it was much more suited to us.
It was related to the previous injury that PLAYER had in CITY and obviously PLAYER did great to be part of that but with that result and with the niggle that PLAYER’s feeling, we decided to take PLAYER off.
Obviously, PLAYER has real belief, the more it happens, the more you believe it, you can tell straight away, the body language from the player, how they communicate that something is coming up which is great and you have various ways of scoring goals it makes the team much more unpredictable, the opposition have to work on many more things so, it’s a good thing for us.
Very important, we had an issue with PLAYER, we have an issue with PLAYER as well, yesterday we lost PLAYER and PLAYER and PLAYER which was very bad news but what I'm really happy about is PLAYER has to come in, PLAYER does really well. PLAYER the same, PLAYER, I thought was exceptional today as well. That’s the level, every three days we’re going to need everybody at their best and it’s a good sign that the team can do that.
And scoring, the fact that they know everybody is on their toes, everybody has to elevate their level and earn the right to play and when you have the chance, it’s the moment to talk and that’s what they’re doing.
Yeah, we've got some momentum. I think we have some flow back. It's great. And, yeah, we're going to enjoy tonight and watch a beautiful game of football tomorrow.
We are in a great moment right now, but in football, be on your toes and be prepared the best possible way for tomorrow because it's so competitive. This league, the position that we are playing every three days, that's the only thing that you can do, you know, analyse what we've done really well. A lot of things to improve and still today, go again tomorrow. 
Incredible. Because it's the hardest thing to do in football. So a player that can deliver those moments and impact the scoreline in that way, you know, the value of that is tremendous. And even if the opponent knows it, he continues to do it. And that's a big credit to him.

57,"I’m very proud of the team especially with the situation that we are going through at the moment, and probably cannot imagine. But overall I think, especially first half, it was a total domination, we were really, really good, really sharp, really efficient, really determined. And the fact we couldn’t see the game off, especially looking at ourselves, the two things that we didn’t do particular well and obviously about other aspects.
I prefer not to comment.
I don’t know, it’s what it is, we had five injuries in the backline, we have to adapt to it, we’ll continue to adapt, it’s a situation that we have, support them, praise the players because the courage they played today was unbelievable and keep going. 
Yeah really disappointed today, I think we were better but especially because in two things that we had to do a lot better we didn’t and some other stuff obviously.
It’s PLAYER’s consistency and the fact that PLAYER’s very young as well and been very lucky with injuries so hopefully PLAYER continues to be there, but after a few weeks off, the way PLAYER played and competed was exceptional. I think we had some big, big individual performances in the team.
We’ve done everything that we possibly could to accelerate that process, and PLAYER was so willing, the team, the medical staff have done amazing work and we gave ourselves the chance to compete. I don’t know the extent of the injury if there is one, the same with PLAYER.
I don’t know but PLAYER could not run, that’s what PLAYER said straight away, so I don’t know what happened. I don’t know if it's the knee joint or the ankle, they are assessing PLAYER right now.
Prefer not to comment.
No, this is football, circumstances are going to make us better and they are making us better. So if we were able to be where we are and competing the manner that we do, I see the team I have no doubts, three days before I told you we are going to be flying on Sunday, and we started flying and were the better team by far. But we needed to grab the points today to make a reflection of where we are and where we want to be, we couldn’t do it but for sure we are there.
I’m more disappointed and frustrated about one thing that we didn’t do, that we had to do in the second half. The physical part we’ll look at all the stats, the stats I know are dropping, we had better stats in the second half in many games especially individually. Some positives like PLAYER for example hasn’t played 90 minutes for five months, or whatever, so a lot of positive things to take and keep on going.
No, nothing. I’m sure we’ll have some clarity or a letter [about the disallowed goal] afterwards, I don’t know.

110,"I didn't say nothing. I will tell it tomorrow, that PLAYER has to rest, eat good food, to prepare Sunday, we need them again. PLAYER did a great job. It is a great moment for a young kid to perform well for a club like this, but PLAYER needs to focus on the next match because this is already in the past, and prepare the next game.
You always believe. I have to believe. But with the chance that, for example, that PLAYER misses, then you have that feeling that, let's go again, a difficult night with our defence. Everything is so fresh, the three losses that we have. But we managed to turn things around and in the end, we didn't do a good game, but if you look for all the opportunities, I think we deserve it. But we have to improve a lot.
I think it's not panic. In the first half, we were too late to every ball and we tried to press a little bit high, and we suffered with that. PLAYER between the lines, PLAYER between the lines, PLAYER with the pace. It's a different game from TEAM and TEAM. We have to stretch the team more. We let PLAYER all the time, one against one, with more spaces to cover, and we suffered more. So I think it's not panic, we need, and I need, to understand the game. Why are we suffering in these kind of games and not sometimes in the big games? Where we are more compact, more near the ball when we win the ball, so I pay attention to all the things. And this game was not the lack of effort. They tried it, but PLAYER was really tired, since the first minute, and you feel when he ran for the ball and tried to receive the ball, all that stuff. So, I look at the game, try to understand the game to improve my players and to help the team to be better.
I don't know. I need to improve the training, sometimes the recovery of the players, I don't know. I have to help them, but after these two games were really hard on the team and sometimes we are tired not just [in] the body, but [in] the mind. But like I said, it's a different game. We have to press more. The space is bigger. We are uncomfortable in the game. And then if we don't manage ball for so long, we suffer, and we feel it in the first half. TEAM left three against three in the back and we couldn't use that space. I can see the game. I will watch it and I will try to help the team improve.
Yes. I had five minutes with PLAYER, to talk about different things, about the game. It was not good at the game, but, in the end, the result helped the conversation. So we continued with our job, it's a really difficult moment, but today was more important. I know the fans want to see so much better football than this. I want to see so much better football than this, but we need time. Like I said in the first days here, to win time, we need to win games. 
Depends on the players, the work that they do. PLAYER has the quality to do that kind of pass, and we need all the players to win games. So 10 minutes or 90 minutes, all the players are important to change the course of the season.
The important thing is to win. Then PLAYER's doing a very good season. So, that's it. I already spoke about this, we have to be careful with the young kids. Was a really good job today. PLAYER has a lot to improve, but this game is in the past. We need to prepare the future. In the game, in football, the life is like this. So, congratulations to PLAYER, to all the team, enjoy tonight, is a very good moment and PLAYER needs to appreciate this moment, but, tomorrow, PLAYER's going to recover and we have to prepare for the next game.
All the players, you have the biggest expectations for all. I'm trying to be really demanding with them. And on the other side of that problem, I also understand when they try it, but they cannot do it. I understand when the pressure of playing at home sometimes is harder than playing away. I understand that sometimes the demands of controlling the game, all the game, against this opponent, sometimes it's harder than to face a big team with zero expectation from everybody. So, I understand these kind of details and I will try to help them be better players and [a] better team.
It's improving what we did wrong in this game. It's a different game. Today was a game, player-to-player. The next game is going to be a completely different game, with a different team, with a different coach. So I will try to explain, in one day, what kind of team we are going to face, what we need to improve, and try to reduce that to two things. And that's it, to try to win the next game.",1.6875,2,Strongly positive,8,1,-1,0,1,-1,1,-2,53,16/01/2025,NA,21,thu,20:00 (21:00),2024/2025,ruben amorim,11,manchester utd,71,manchester utd,71,southampton,103,southampton,103,old trafford,1,3,1,3.11,1.37,3.11-1.37,3,1,2,3.11,1.37,1.74,0.26,1,0,1,73722,john brooks
65,"It’s a very difficult place to come, when you see their record at home, the way they play, the way they cause issues to opponents, very impressive, on top of that, we went a goal down. So then, it becomes a big mountain to climb, but I think the team showed a lot of composure, was very calm emotionally because we needed that in today’s game and as well had the right desire to keep insisting, attacking them and do it in a way that can cause them problems, which is difficult. So, overall, I think we deserved the result.
Hopefully that the watch didn’t vibrate! Obviously, it was a very unusual action from PLAYER, it happens and we’re lucky that the goal didn’t go in, probably it would’ve changed the game. So, good, the team adapted, we lost some players again before the game, we have a little issue, the team still performs, the roles are there and with a young player in the starting line-up which is great to see, that played with a courage and a determination as well.
That position wasn’t because of a bug, that was a decision we made because I thought PLAYER was the best player to play in the position to start the game and because there was a story there, with ‘PLAYER’s debut here. PLAYER made PLAYER’s league debut and sometimes that feeling comes in and you feel it’s the right one and who knows.
Part of that development is patience, managing frustration or managing expectation, or you expect that everything is going to go so fast, like the previous things happen and it’s not the case. So we’re building PLAYER, PLAYER’s already played a lot of games a lot of minutes for the age that PLAYER’s got and fully deserves that.
But these things happen, I mean, in this period there’s always things; throat infections, viruses, so I tried to delay the line-up as well as far as possible because you can get up in the morning and have a surprise unfortunately.
When I see the willingness of each individual to play through anything and the versatility that we can create within our idea, the answer is no. But we don’t know, if something else happens, then would have more issues but hopefully not, hopefully people are coming back, like PLAYER today, PLAYER was back and other players that are there are in top form as well, we need everybody.
Yes and we discuss about that option because it can happen and then the game folds in the hands exactly what they want but, we managed to turn things around, the timing of it was really good so we were really lucky that we took that advantage early the second half and then it was a different game.
Very good, it’s because PLAYER deserves it and the type of game that we have to play and the amount of density that they defend when they are deep requires people with a lot of threat in the box and PLAYER’s a master of that and we believe with this unit on the left we can have the dynamics that we wanted so, very good, PLAYER scored a very, very important goal again PLAYER’s always there, PLAYER’s a big threat, so, great to have these options.
That’s something general but there are certain teams that are so good at doing certain things and you have to manage that every game.
Very good timing, both of them, really important. It’s great, that’s what we need, people up front has to be firing, has to be with that feeling and they are with that feeling right now. They are so consistent with the way they behave, they train, they want it and goals are about moments as well and about the feeling and the energy that a player is in right now, they’re in a good mood right now.",1,2,Strongly positive,1,6,0.75,0.833333333,1.483333333,-1,0,-0.733333333,1,01/01/2025,NA,19,wed,17:30 (18:30),2024/2025,mikel arteta,3,arsenal,6,brentford,22,arsenal,6,brentford,22,gtech community,0,1,3,0.27,2,0.27-2.0,3,1,2,2,0.27,1.73,0.27,1,0,1,47190,peter bankes
73,"Happiness, especially about the performance of the players, and for our fans here today.
We knew it was an important game for our fans, for the club, and so the players performed really well today. We struggled a little bit at the beginning of the game and at the beginning of the second-half, but then we got the game under control, so overall, a great performance.
I love football and this atmosphere. I mentioned it at the press conference: we prepared like we prepare every single league game the whole season, [with] what we want to do, how we want to play, their strengths, their weaknesses, especially our strengths… and then, today, we talked about how important it is for our fans.
The fans have always supported us the whole season. Even when we had the defeats at the beginning of the season, they were always behind the team, behind us, and we said maybe it's an opportunity for us to give them a little bit back, and maybe a gift!
The players – I mention it quite often – are great characters, so they gave the gift to our fans, and I hope they enjoyed the afternoon.
We know that they play with a high line, defending person-to-person. PLAYER’s strength is pace, and then we knew we could get PLAYER there.
PLAYER's more confident than at the beginning of the season, PLAYER feels better.
PLAYER understands better and better how we want to play as a team, what PLAYER has to do – also with PLAYER, because there was one disallowed goal where PLAYER would assist and PLAYER the goal – this is getting better and better, so we are really pleased.
I’m very proud. We spoke about it before. We always call it ‘in the crunch time’: there are usually two, three, four, five new players on the pitch, and then we can win as a team.
We changed our system to a 3-5-2 after half-time, we didn't get pressure on the ball, and then we could see all the quality they have in their attacking formation, and we needed PLAYER with some big saves in this situation.
Then with the substitutions, it's completely normal. PLAYER and PLAYER worked quite hard for the team, so then with PLAYER and PLAYER we got more pressure on the ball, we got the game more into their half, and then we created chances.

6,"You always have to do a lot, especially in the league. And that was also [the case] today, because we went 1-0 down. The league table is something of course we are aware of, but we also understand how many games there are still to play.
I think that was crucial today. I was happy with the first-half performance, I was happy with the start. There was only one minute I wasn’t happy with and that was the minute we conceded a goal, that was I think the only thing we didn’t do well during the first half. We created from the start our chances, we threatened them a lot, brought a lot of balls into the box where we arrived with many players – I saw PLAYER many times in front of goal. So, I could not have asked for that much more. But I think it was crucial to score the 1-1 just before half-time because that lifted us up and you could see that immediately in the second half, where we just kept on going with what we did. It was not only helpful for us, but I think it also worked the opposite way for TEAM, they felt like, ‘OK, now it’s going to be tough.’
Yeah, great goal again. Similar to the first one from PLAYER. Like I said, we arrived there many times and if these players – like PLAYER, like PLAYER, like PLAYER, like PLAYER, like PLAYER – if they arrive often enough in promising positions, they will deliver.
I think the main difference maybe is that the set-up of the front three was a bit different [in the past] than the set-up now. We expect a bit from our wingers to keep it wide, to try to get them in one-v-one situations. PLAYER has done this really well. PLAYER has done this really well when PLAYER played from the left but PLAYER is, in our opinion, also capable of playing as a nine; PLAYER did that really well against TEAM. Against TEAM it was mainly maybe PLAYER and PLAYER that were dominant, now it was PLAYER again, together with PLAYER. It’s just nice to have so many options, in every position actually but also in the front three.
I think if you’re in this game for a long time, like these players are and I am as well, then you know 20 games before the end you don’t look at it. You know so many challenges are still ahead of you. I think it was two months ago we were one point behind TEAM and look what has happened there; in terms of injuries and then you have a bit of bad luck, you have a suspension. This can happen to any team, so it’s far too early to already be celebrating.

Because we had so many good situations and so many positive things, I don't feel 100 percent happy today. But also to stay humble: it was a very good week for us.
Overall, it was a very, very positive week for us. Also, the performance is getting better and better, so many, many positive things, but still things where we have to work on and to improve in the future.
We try playing forward and creating chances, and TEAM as well. It was [the same] today, it feels like: ‘Come on, bring it home, bring it over the goal line!’

81,"I think it’s the biggest difference to the last result at TEAM: it's the same result, but there's a massive difference in the performances.
Today was a great performance, we controlled the game the whole time, so I'm really pleased with the result and with the performance today – whereas at TEAM I was just pleased with the result!
It felt like we controlled the game. We didn't give them chances – two or three set-plays, but we defended it excellently – and then it was ‘okay, when we come into the final third or when we come in front of their defensive five, we need to increase the pace of attack’.
We found three or four times our wing-backs, and to be honest the crosses were not as well today that we all hoped and expected, but again: great performance.
In the first-half I think we controlled the game but we didn't create many chances – also TEAM defended their box pretty well – but in the second-half we were talking about overloading and finding good positions, and there's a build-up from the back and it starts and when PLAYER gets the ball, PLAYER's completely free because PLAYER's moving into the free space, and then can make pressure on the defence, and then PLAYER is always running.
It was a little bit similar at TEAM – it was PLAYER getting the ball in this area, making pressure and finding the right moment for the pass, and this is what we're always training and talking to them about. PLAYER also worked hard like all the others today in our defensive shape.
I think it started weeks ago, and I always talked about PLAYER, PLAYER and PLAYER and PLAYER. They never played together until later, because when PLAYER arrived he was injured immediately, then PLAYER was injured, so you need time to train.
Everybody knows how we want to defend in the back three, but it starts in the beginning. We had five to 10 minutes in the second half where TEAM were too dominant, because we got a little bit tired and we didn't close the spaces with our attacking players, we gave them passes we don't want them to give, and then we had to react.
The subs had a very good impact today, and not just PLAYER, also in the defensive structure. We were more compact again, and this is always teamwork. Sometimes we need PLAYER with a big save, but today I think he didn't need to have a big save, so that's always the best for me as a manager.
It feels great, and I was talking to PLAYER when we went to our fans after the game.
We could see their support. There were moments in the second-half when our fans were louder than the many TEAM supporters, so thanks again –and then let's keep it going next match.",1,2,Strongly positive,3,3,0.333333333,1.555555556,0.666666667,-2,0,-0.333333333,59,18/01/2025,NA,22,sat,15:00 (16:00),2024/2025,oliver glasner,8,crystal palace,36,west ham,117,crystal palace,36,west ham,117,london,0,0,2,0.22,1.63,0.22-1.63,2,0,2,1.63,0.22,1.41,0.59,1,0,1,62469,thomas bramall

For me, the main job is to make sure the players really understand the way we want to play together and what I expect from them. At the moment, they just have a lot of confidence. It's good they can show themselves on the field.
I was aware of that, but I didn't talk at all with my players before the game about that. I think that it's a new era and we're in a different dynamic from last season.
We knew before the game that it would be a tough game. We had to have a great performance if we wanted to have a good result.
We were really focused on set-pieces because we knew it was one of their strengths. We did well. We conceded some corners and free-kicks, but we were really strong defensively and that's part of our mentality - making things hard for the opposition.
Even if it has maybe been a great start - we haven't won anything yet.

68,"Yes, I'm extremely proud of all the players. You can talk about our courage, you can talk about the spirit, but as well about intelligence. The way they managed emotionally the game, it was unbelievable. And especially with what we have to face and how they felt about it. All of them, just face the situation, the challenge. We went to the second half, the only message was to go out there and help to win the game. That's it. Somebody doesn't feel it, don't go. And they certainly did it in a very convincing way.
Hopefully we don’t need to, and if we have to, it happened and it’s a really good precedent for what happened with PLAYER as well this season. Ok we were in a position that we shouldn’t be in but at least be in a position we should be in for the next few weeks and allow our players to continue to show up.
That's what they show us every single day and this season has been very special for many circumstances, a lot of them very challenging today. We had two again. We have PLAYER out. PLAYER out. Still, we come here. We have to face a very difficult opponent. We have another issue during the match. Still, we go about it. So that's what I love about them. And I think that's why our supporters celebrated and they were behind them because they can feel that.
Especially because we put so much work and hours and passion and dedication into what we do, that regardless of what happens, what is thrown there, you have to continue to have that desire and that will to win and overcome that situation. Because now you're going to throw it through the window. And, it’s my job. It's our job as well to deal with certain things, and, unfortunately, we're getting used to it.
Well, as I said, I prefer not to comment on the actual thing, we cannot change actually what happened today. Hopefully, it will be fair for the team and for the player and for everybody what is going to happen in the next few weeks.
We’ve been ticking a lot I think this season about that one and I’m not surprised because the will that the team has to compete, to again show that ok, any context is good for us and we can adapt to that and we’re going to face it. So on that I have no doubts.

39,"It's always important for us, for the players, for the Club and above all for our fans.
This result against this kind of team is always special. It always means more things for the confidence of the players too late on like this.
We were able to overcome bad moments in the first half and were able to keep a positive and good mentality.
In the first half, it was important that we kept a clean sheet.
Obviously, there were some good moments from our goalkeeper, from the defenders and some luck, but 0-0 at half-time, it was a good way to move on.
I was thinking that maybe we could change a few different things [at half-time]. We had two players with a yellow card (who were both replaced). We needed to win more individual fights.
We needed to be more aggressive with our ball. We needed to be more dangerous in [attack]. So, that's why we were thinking about PLAYER in the second half and we put on PLAYER and PLAYER too.
They did well, but it's about all the team, so we are happy for them. The mental approach of the players, taking the ball, taking the game to TEAM.
You could feel the energy in the stadium and that worked with the players and the fans and it all came together.
This energy is always special. Sometimes when you go down, they don't allow you to go down. And it's very important to feel this kind of energy from the fans, above all in the bad moments.
It's very, very important that the players feel in the bad moments that the energy of our fans is there and the support too. So, I think that he has been key today for us. And there were a lot of good moments in the second half.
I have to review the match, but I think that we did well in the second half. Very clear [opportunities].
It's true that there were other moments in the match. Unfortunately, we suffered one goal again, but after this goal, we kept a good mentality. I am happy for this.
Sometimes it happens that we go down after one goal and we have to... this is the league. The league doesn't allow you chances if you are not able to compete until the end and to overcome bad moments. You have to keep this mentality and be stronger and stronger, always.

77,"It’s a good result here at TEAM. They are really in very good shape. The last five games, they won four and had just one draw, coming with a 3-0 win at STADIUM, so we knew it would be a tough game.
We expected the game to be how it was. Very intense, many duels. They were playing very straight in behind, having a lot of pace and sometimes it's not so easy to defend.
On the other side, when you have the ball, they always make pressure, you never have time, and in some situations we did really well, when we moved the ball quickly and created our moments, so this is a good point.
I think we defended really well. We were very focused and concentrated, especially on the long balls in behind.
We struggled a little bit in the first half with the set-plays and we knew it was a little bit different. Usually they deliver to the near post, this time they delivered all the corners to the far post, blocking our players. We had some adjustments in the second-half and then it wasn't a problem anymore.
On the other side, in our attack, we had a good situation with PLAYER in the first-half, we had a finish from PLAYER, we had a good finish from PLAYER in the second-half. Overall, we can still improve of course, but today it was important to get the result, and this is what we did.
When a team plays like them, it's always giving you a lot of pressure. Either you win your duel, then you create an overload, or you have to pass very quick, and this isn't very accurate.
In more situations, the last pass we won in the first-half, and then the ball is maybe half a yard in the back. This is the last accuracy maybe we missed in our attack. But again, it's important to defend, this is what we did today.
I think what we can do better: especially when we win the ball, sometimes we lose it too easily. First or second pass, the ball is gone again.
But the team is working so hard and investing so much, and [we want to] just make it a little bit easier for them on the pitch, giving us more moments, more momentum, a little bit more calmness. This is what we are working on.
But on the other side, I could see very good moments from our attacking side. PLAYER had a good chance again, being in the box. We were unlucky, I think some shots were blocked.

They’ve been in top form, they did better than anyone they played here, so to play to the level, with the determination, the purpose, and the fluidity that we've done today, very pleased.
It's true that the result is very different from the performance, and as well the intensity of the opponent that we faced when we played TEAM. I was so pleased with what I saw, and I knew that in that pathway, good things were going to happen. Today we've been able to do that and replicate it and be even more efficient in the opposition half. And, I'm very pleased because the team played with so much courage, because they are so good. Watching them live, I realised how good they are.
Yes, PLAYER was again, I think all the players. If not you don't have the dominant performance and the scoreline that we have managed to get on the game today, they were all exceptional today. 
Yes, because you cannot speculate and we had a period after 39, 40 minutes that we started to do that and I had to stop it because that's the tendency the team wants to do, to control it. We are not good at doing that. Unfortunately, they scored very early in the second half and that created some momentum. But we dealt with it really well. As I said, it was a big performance and we're really happy.
For sure, the performance was there a few times and when we played big teams. When we played TEAM, we were exceptional, again, when we played TEAM we were exceptional and some mistakes cost us. Now it’s TEAM, now it’s this level, that’s the level we have to be able to cope and you have to make it happen, then that creates belief, then on the next one the players will be better prepared. We need that consistency because the ability to do it is there.
A lot, because we were training with 11-12 players for a long period so they could not train and play, and then suddenly almost everybody is fit and available. It’s true, we are still managing certain players but their level is rising. I have no doubt we have the right ability, we are going to be a really good side.
We don’t know because PLAYER said PLAYER was feeling some discomfort. I was about to make the change of PLAYER but I couldn’t make the sub and we had to make other ones.
I would agree with you, I think it’s one of the best performances I have seen from PLAYER, especially the way PLAYER’s dominated the game so that’s the level he can play, PLAYER’s progressing.

104,"We knew it was going to be a tough game, TEAM is a very good team, as a team, but also the individual qualities that they have and set pieces, obviously, they hurt us in the away game. Very good side, it was a game with a lot of different phases and we were aware of that and we’re going to have to control different phases of the game and try to, even without the ball, try to dictate and dominate. So I think the team were superb in staying calm and composed in all phases of the game and kept on believing.
Looking at the team before the game, they were very composed, energetic and just looking forward to the challenge and to try and beat TEAM and without any pressure, trying to go out and play the our way and making that way win games. We didn’t play our way for as many minutes as we would’ve wanted to but to be honest the weather conditions were quite hard to deal with today.
PLAYER’s a fantastic player, works so hard. But then showing this mental resilience as well. It just says everything about who PLAYER is as a player but again I want to credit the whole team because this is really really again, a team performance.
Trying to frame the challenges in a good way and the players work on that. The players have been working really hard in training and their preparations, they’ve been working really hard with their recovery because there’s been a lot of travelling and short turnarounds, so they’ve been very professional.
It’s a very intimate place here, you feel very close to the supporters, you can almost hear them talking, you can hear all the songs and I think the players were really connecting with them as well and they could really feel it. I think we had phases in the game where we struggled a little bit and TEAM had a bit more of the ball but then they kept us going through but then we clear the ball and go forward, those small things that you can reinforce that and hear the crowd and it really helps the players go forward and keep believing.
I think the players are very eager as well. They need a break, they need to recharge physically and mentally, but then they set their minds on it and want to keep going.

In a high level game when you are not able to do more, you just give more confidence to the opposition. Today, maybe we should've done more, been more efficient and that would've changed the game for sure.
We had some great moments in the game. We still have to work on some others, but I'm just happy with theresult. It's always good.
It was a wonderful. Especially because we were talking with PLAYER and trying to make PLAYER realise that PLAYER can sometimes come in and shoot with PLAYER left foot. PLAYER's been practicing that and I'm so happy because it worked tonight. It will give PLAYER more confidence for the other games, and the defenders it will make it harder for them because she is unpredictable. If PLAYER's able to go on the right or left foot, it is something really good for PLAYER and the team.
It's always important. We were at home in STADIUM with the fans and this will bring some good confidence to the players and to the team.
Even if we know we can be better in parts of the game, we will analyse that and give some feedback to the team.
I think we need to give credit to TEAM and I knew that before the game because they were able to beat TEAM [in pre-season] last weekend. They will make some trouble to other teams in the league.
This is why the league is so competitive. The other teams are getting better and better. It's always good to start with that.
We started well, I think sometimes with what we've been working on, we didn't recognise during the game where we should have played, but you have to take into account the scenario of the game, especially the second half because TEAM were trying to score and put a lot of pressure on us.
When the opposition is putting you under pressure, you have to be able to find maybe a more direct style of play beyond their backline. That's the way it works sometimes because if you keep playing short when the opposition is pressing you, it is sometimes difficult.

We missed several percentages. Out of possession, several percentages. In possession, we lost the ball too easily, too quick, and then the pressure increased. Also in defence, it was sometimes half-pressure, half being in shape, and then TEAM are too good, so that's a little bit frustrating today.

They had too much possession in our half, in the final third, and then it's just a question of time with their quality. We knew with all their quality, we gave them too many chances because we were too passive. They were too long in our final third.
The positive thing is that scoring here is not too easy. Not many teams score at the STADIUM – this is good.

Sunday took its toll and I just thought we looked a little leggy, but we just had to see the game out!
I thought it was a great response to the equaliser, really sharp in our minds. I think we deserved to win the game without it being our best performance, I think these are the sorts of performances that are always in this part of the season and we did the job and that’s the main thing.
I have to try and manage PLAYER because PLAYER’s been out and to come in, play for 45 minutes the other day in tough circumstances, managed to get another 70 out of PLAYER today. We have to take care of PLAYER because PLAYER just needs to look after PLAYER’s knee.
It’s PLAYER’s mentality, straight from the kick-off PLAYER gets straight into a great situation, provides an amazing assist for PLAYER and it’s great to have PLAYER back.
It’s really weird playing the same team twice. I felt confident coming into the game, I always thought it’d be a different game here.
The game was comfortable, but they were always in it. I had a lot of experience on the pitch and the way we managed that last part and adapted again, I thought was outstanding from the team.
Right now it’s just getting the job done and then on to the next one. That’s all we’re thinking about now – Sunday – and then on Sunday I then get the chance to reflect where we really are.
PLAYER has contributions to the team goals, own goalscoring record, and work rate is phenomenal. On Sunday PLAYER ran PLAYER’s socks off and yet PLAYER’s run for another 90 minutes here. Unbelievable team player, will do anything for the team and so deserving with what PLAYER’s getting and the recognition.",1.85,2,Strongly positive,2,5,0.8,0.64,1.2,0,1,-0.4,102,28/04/2022,NA,NA,NA,NA,2021/2022,emma hayes,1,chelsea,32,chelsea,32,tottenham,110,tottenham,110,kingsmedow,1,2,1,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,NA,NA
15,"It was absolutely superb from PLAYER from start to finish. It brings confidence to the back-line. PLAYER’s ability to play out from the back plus making saves like PLAYER did, PLAYER is growing in a TEAM shirt and alongside PLAYER were players of the match for us.
It was a great finish from PLAYER and exactly where we wanted to exploit them. We took that opportunity really, really well on the counter.
It felt like the reverse fixture to two weeks ago, where they went 1-0 up early and then defend in great numbers in the second half. It was the same for us in this game.
We scored early and had the better of the first half and defended really, really well, with the unbelievable performance from PLAYER. At this level you have to take your chances and we took our one chance.
We only had one registered centre-back, I had to play PLAYER there, and one centre-forward, and I lost PLAYER tonight, so we were pretty thin so it was a tremendous result for the team and gutsy from us.
Since Christmas we have got better defensively, we’ve been much better organised and much tougher to break down. There aren't a lot of things between these two teams and I think they've been in a stronger position. They've had fewer games than us. They've been able to play the same line-up. I haven't.

[It was] not luck, as you have to work very hard to have this luck. Sometimes you are a little lucky, but in the end the team is ready to suffer, to run, to fight and take advantage of our strengths.
Of course, we have to improve but I prefer to keep the good things, and today the good things for sure is that we overcame a very good team.
They had clear chances, we did too.
We have to insist on this. We have to improve other things for sure, but we are happy with the result and we have to keep on with that.
Today has been a very demanding match, physically, and unfortunately we had a problem in the warm-up with PLAYER’s hamstring.
We had to make a change, but in the end we overcame all of these difficulties as a team.

75,"It was the most important thing today – we were speaking about it before, you know in these games, everybody is expecting a win. You play TEAM, a team that got promoted, at home, and they had a very difficult start in the league.
But it's a new manager, they have new energy. And then, [we were] starting well into the game, and all of a sudden we were down with their first situation in our box.
Then, the reaction was really great. We played forwards, created chances from set-plays – we were really dangerous today with our set-plays – and then coming back, so it was a really very important.
Especially now we wanted it for our fans, for the club, for us.
I'm very pleased for PLAYER, personally, because PLAYER's investing, and I know PLAYER's always...had so many situations and chances, and this started this season, so maybe this is the circle of football.
PLAYER started at TEAM with a disallowed goal after 10 minutes, and I think PLAYER really suffered with this disallowed goal for many, many games, then hitting the post and missing chances, and then getting injured… and so I hope now is the end of 2024 and so I'm really very pleased for him.
I'm pretty sure that this will give PLAYER confidence and he will do well in 2025 for us.
It’s not so easy when you're all of a sudden down, but this reaction I really loved today, and this is how we want to play.
In the second-half we could have decided the game when we had a little bit more accuracy in our final balls. This is also a topic we are having in many games. I remember the TEAM game at home and we scored an equaliser in the 95th, but we had four or five big chances before and it was similar today.
But today, again, we were great in set-plays and this is what we will work on in the future to improve in these parts – but the way we played, the belief, even when we were down, was great – so I think, overall, it was a very good.
But the team really worked always hard, and as I mentioned so often and I also want to mention now, this is a great group of players I'm working with and this is what I appreciate. It's not that everything is perfect, but they are really always so hard-working, always sticking together, always believing in us, in the team, and so this really makes it a lot of fun.
But also to be self-critical, I think we should have done better in some parts of the season, and this is what we want to improve in the future. I always start with myself, so I think also I can do things better than I did, but overall I think it was an amazing end of last season and I think with this also very positive direction now, I think everything is okay.",1.166666667,2,Strongly positive,6,2,0.9,0.9,1.25,1.8,1.5,-0.35,69,20/12/2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024/2025,oliver glasner,8,crystal palace,36,crystal palace,36,southampton,103,southampton,103,selhurst park,1,2,1,NA,NA,NA,2,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,1,NA,NA
79,"Job done, I would say it was a good start. Then, we controlled the game.
In the second-half we controlled the game, we gave them one big chance – it was our mistake in the build-up.
Then it's always at the end, they have long balls, throw-ins, always kicking the ball into the box… we defended really well, so overall, it was good.
I don't want to have possession just to have possession, I always want to have possession for scoring goals.
In some moments we missed the moment to make the runs in behind, to threaten their defence – and also compliments to them, they did well. When we analysed them we could see it's not too easy against them, they’re very aggressive, a very physical team, playing very direct, forward, having strikers with good physicality.
Thank you for the great support again here today. There was a great atmosphere in the stadium.
First of all, we needed some players, because we had many ill players during the week, so it was good for PLAYER to get many minutes,” 
PLAYER was injured and now back, so really delighted for PLAYER personally, and of course it gives us more options. The same with PLAYER, getting many minutes; also for PLAYER, worked so hard, and was really unlucky in some situations for scoring a goal, but again he was good.
PLAYER got many minutes, and it was a very good game today – so overall, everything we wanted to manage, with the load and the minutes we could do, after the players were ill, and then we will have to wait for the rest of them.
I mentioned it before the game, we always enter the game to win it, regardless if it's home or away, regardless if it's TEAM or TEAM, now it's for players who played today [to have] recovery.
The others who were not in training for almost a whole week are now getting back into the best shape and fitness, so it's a very individual schedule for the next two days.

96,"I’m delighted, for the players, for the staff, for everyone whose worked really hard, it’s been coming, to be honest, and I think in possession we were superb today, in the first half in particular. I think we made life really, really difficult for them. I think that’s helped by the fans, who were fantastic again today and they got right behind the team. A real big thank you to the fans.
It was great to see the work that we’ve been putting into training coming off on the pitch. PLAYER created that chance from being a little bit higher, PLAYER was really positive on the ball, and the timing of the run and the release of the pass was superb to eliminate their backline.
I think PLAYER’s first touch was outstanding to draw the goalkeeper in with real composure around the box. It’s a fantastic goal and a lot of people contributed to those chances being created.
We are hard working all the time, and that’s something we definitely don’t want to ever switch off from. There hasn’t been a moment in any game this season where we’ve not tried to do everything we can to try and effect things.
From a players’ perspective, I think they’ve done a fantastic job. We dealt with a little bit of pressure from them in the first ten to 15 minutes and then we started to take control of the game. At that point, it became quite one-sided in possession.
Defensively we have been really difficult to break down, but it’s just not crossed over into as many points as we would have liked so far.
This is an important result. We felt we should have got a point out of last week as well, so it’s going to kick start things for us moving forward, I’m sure.
PLAYER put in her programme notes about the '12th person' and I heard them today. Towards the end, TEAM had a couple of corners and there’s moments in games where you wonder which way it’s going to go, and today I didn’t feel that at all.
I knew we were going to defend them how we needed to and the fans seem to feel that as well. They were getting right behind the team and that was really good to hear. It gives a massive lift to the players.
Everybody’s pushing and working really hard, trying to spur the players on, and the players are working as hard as they can. Collectively, it’s a real team and fans effort.
We’re evolving both sides of our game. I’ve said it before, we’ve played four of last year’s top five. It’s been a tough start to the season for us, but defensively we’ve done really well and the performances have been good.",1.566666667,2,Strongly positive,3,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,30,10/11/2024,NA,7,sun,15:00 (16:00),2024/2025,rehanne skinner,2,west ham,116,west ham,116,leicester,57,leicester,57,chigwell construction,1,1,0,NA,NA,NA,1,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1617,elizabeth simms
22,"I am very happy with the performance today because in some moments on the ball, we were unbelievable. There were some good combinations and the way we prepared the game was exactly there. Off the ball, they fought together and showed they deserved the result. This is important.
We tried to do something different. We moved PLAYER to the left side and PLAYER for the first time this season into the left pocket. The reason was to try to attack down that side and a bigger reason was to have PLAYER in the right pocket. In the end, it worked very well.
The problem is if you attack quick, you are going to concede a quick attack and it’s not our idea, it’s not our football. Today with PLAYER on one side, PLAYER the other, PLAYER in the pocket, PLAYER in the pocket, and PLAYER there, they are also good at making passes and arriving in the last third to create and score goals.
This kind of game is a game that before you attack, you need to make 15 or 20 passes. If you want to attack with two passes, it’s a long distance and they can recover the ball and create and cause problems. So the reason I was shouting ""calm, calm, calm, make passes"" is because if you make it an up-and-down game, they destroy everything.
It’s football and I’m the guy who asks PLAYER to do that [playing out from the back]. PLAYER is going to do that because the moment PLAYER stops, PLAYER isn’t going to play. If PLAYER makes a mistake, it’s not PLAYER’s problem, it’s my problem, my mistake, because I ask that of PLAYER.
I am happy with how PLAYER is playing and building from the back. All the goal kicks we had where PLAYER passed to PLAYER and PLAYER that kind of ball gave us a chance to attack.

44,"We knew this challenge was very, very tough for a lot of reasons. They have a new coach, one good team and they showed this against TEAM. They have a new set up and big energy and marking person to person.
In these kinds of matches, if you are not right tactically and if and you don't have the right mentality, it is not good. That's why I highlight the mentality that we started with. We had very two clear chances, first with PLAYER and the other with PLAYER.
After they had a good moment, they had two or three clear chances.
Unfortunately, we started having problems with injuries, with PLAYER and with PLAYER. Fortunately, PLAYER is conscious and well now in the dressing room, which is the most important thing. With PLAYER, we have to wait, but I am not optimistic.
After, we had one problem with PLAYER, too, in the half, so we had to change PLAYER [at half-time], so I think that we had a lot of problems today. That's why I highlight the mentality of the team.
It's true that all the players were ready to be actors on the pitch.
PLAYER showed that as PLAYER started on the bench, and then started playing in this kind of match. It's not easy, but PLAYER showed PLAYER’s mentality and was ready. PLAYER, too, did the same. In the second half, PLAYER, too.
After that, PLAYER was injured in the last two weeks and he had to play in an important moment for the match, and showed that PLAYER was ready. PLAYER, too, did well, and so did PLAYER, too, in the last part of the match. 
Always, all the players have to be ready because the alarm clock is always going to wake you up, so you have to be ready.
We had good action.
It’s true that in the second half, we didn't suffer a lot of clear chances that I can remember. 
In the first half, yes we did suffer some clear chances but to highlight, I repeat that we handled a very tough match today and we handled big problems with injuries and this kind of situation.
So, we have to keep with this mentality and to be ready for the next challenge that is going to be enormous, and we have to be ready to use all our players.
I think that I need to highlight this, as the support of the fans has been incredible and we work for them. We are happy for them, and today we are happy because of the commitment of the players.

102,"I think they were world class today, they are both world class players, we tried to prep them as best as could as it’s a new partnership. PLAYER plays in that role, always, but it’s new for PLAYER. But PLAYER is so intelligent as a player we were very confident PLAYER would solve it. There were a couple of details we went through from a defensive perspective that were new for PLAYER, for example what’s PLAYER’s role in a low block, but otherwise it was quite straightforward. So I’m very happy and I think they worked well together as well so their collaboration on the pitch was very good and they played to each others strengths so well done to both of them.
Players coming on, a couple of energy injections, but we did some changes at half-time and after 30 minutes in the first half from a defensive formation perspective, which helped. But otherwise it wasn’t changing things so much in the second half, it was more about can we play the game in the spaces on the pitch where we want to be and I think at times we did that after those 15-20 minutes where we struggled a little bit, even though I wouldn’t want to say struggle because yes, they had a couple crosses and this breakthrough where PLAYER blocks the shot and they have one more blocked shot by PLAYER but that’s it, so they didn’t create much, it’s just we are used to having the majority of possession and we didn’t have that in that period of the game, I think it’s 50-50, shared with TEAM. So that’s different for us, but I think the ruthlessness we showed today again and the control we have, even though we have to defend a little bit, we do that really well and we put a lot of value on that as a team.
It was a bit of both, PLAYER plays a lot for us, PLAYER plays a lot for the COUNTRY, we felt comfortable in the game, as a team, and it was important for us to get PLAYER back in the groove as well, give PLAYER a decent amount of minutes so it was a little bit of both.
We pay a lot of attention on how we act in both boxes, how we defend our own box and how we attack the opposition box and I think that’s where games are being won and lost, that’s what we put focus on. We don’t look at the table with the team and look at positions in the table and goal difference, that’s not what we do, that needs to be a result of that, so we try to work on specifics that we can control but definitely have more focus on how we defend the box and how we attack the box.
I think we defend as a team, that’s what we’re good at, and I think we attack as a team so, obviously, it’s our forwards most of the time getting on the end of attacks but credit to the whole team and how we create at the moment. But, for example, in training, we’ve been working specifically with the forwards, so PLAYER is with us and we spend a little bit more time with the forwards, working on their finishing specifically so that’s in their roles and that hopefully is a part of why we are so clinical and ruthless at the moment. I think PLAYER puts in great detail so. But again, it’s all in the players, how much effort and investment that comes from them and I think we’re in a good place at the moment and we need to maintain that.
The height of the press was the same, at least for the second half so we wanted to press the same height with PLAYER as we did with PLAYER and PLAYER, but in an attack, obviously, PLAYER is used usually as a nine, PLAYER comes down as a 10, that is specific space that we want PLAYER to find in the 10 role, and then someone else needs to fill another space. But, again, we want to play to the players strengths and PLAYER probably comes a little higher, a little closer to the number nine position but, I think, with all the creativity and all the players around, we still fill the spaces that we want.
I think that’s exactly what it is. I think at the start of the season we were really good as well. We outperformed our opponent in almost everything, we didn’t score as many goals, and what that is, yes, I said, we work on a lot of specific stuff in both boxes, but I can’t say exactly one thing, it’s a cocktail of things that are working together at the moment.
Yes, I think so, we have to believe that. But we’re happy we’re in the top three at the moment, we won’t settle for third place of course, so we try to go for more and that’s the same in the league group, we want to go for first place as well so we’re not settling, we’re not happy yet. But obviously a good step.
I’m enjoying it, I’m having fun, it’s also very hard work. Sometimes you forget to enjoy it as well, because there are so many things that need to be done, from a planning and preparation and reviewing perspective, so you’re working most of the time but matchdays and these results and seeing these fans, being able to play for so many fans, that’s moments where you really feel the enjoyment and happy about what you’re doing, definitely.
I’m not thinking about me making statements, we’re just trying to help the team perform and get the results we need, and at the moment that’s working really well, how the whole team has invested in defending together, I think that’s things we talk about and what separates us from the rest, that’s one thing for example, so we’re very happy with that, so it’s all about the team.",0.788888889,2,Strongly positive,9,4,1.25,0.375,1.25,1,2,0,20,08/12/2024,NA,9,sun,14:00 (15:00),2024/2025,renÃ£Â©e slegers,7,arsenal,5,arsenal,5,aston villa,8,aston villa,8,emirates,1,4,0,3.1,0.4,3.1-0.4,4,0,4,3.1,0.4,2.7,1.3,1,0,0,29515,abigail byrne
27,"It’s an important result, firstly for the way it arrived, because to come in this stadium against this team and concede two goals, and then continue with the same plan on and off the ball, shows how the players are mentally strong.
We are trying to work with the players on and off the pitch, but we’re also trying to work on mentality and togetherness. To come in this stadium and think you are going to win without suffering is impossible.
For that, probably it’s the perfect result because two goals down, it was the worst picture for us, even if we were in control. We conceded two goals from PLAYER, we created chances, we controlled the game, we kept the ball. At half-time we changed something tactically, and second half we deserved the result.
There was no problem first half. The plan was working well, we were attacking and controlling the game after conceding two goals. I was very happy.
The only thing was watching the way they were pressing. First half we had PLAYER on one side, and PLAYER on the other. Second half we had PLAYER on one side, and PLAYER on the other, and we changed something in behind. It was for this reason, it worked quite well.
After the game, my message to the players was to be focused day by day, in the next game, because if you start to think about where we are in three or four games, it’s completely wrong.

114,"A great result and a good performance - especially in the first half. We were able tonight to rotate the squad a little bit. It was an opportunity for me to show some trust to all of my squad. Some players had opportunities to show themselves and they did well. A lot of positives to take from this game.
We want to stay consistent in the game and the best respect you can show to the opposing team is to play to a high level all through the game.
It's also an opportunity for the manager to rotate a little bit more in the squad. Giving the opportunity for some players to come in. Maybe, in the second half, we were more transitional and I wanted us to be able to keep more of the ball, but I think as a team we did really well.
I'm enjoying it so much. I've already said that for me I am so passionate about football. Football has been my life forever. I started to play football when I was six, so having the opportunity to be the TEAM manager - that's the dream you want to have. I'm in a good place. I think we're doing a good job with the squad and I'm really enjoying working with these players.
PLAYER is a really good player. I don't see PLAYER’s age, it is more about PLAYER’s performing with the team and at the moment PLAYER's doing really well. Even if PLAYER's young, PLAYER's really confident with the ball and can make a good impact for the team. PLAYER's able to possess the ball under pressure, able to make the team play and is able to score. From a young player, that's really high expectations but PLAYER's performing in a big club with a lot of good players around.
PLAYER's a really talented player, a lot of quality. Sometimes PLAYER wants to start every single game which is good because I really like when players are competitive.
So, sometimes PLAYER needs to be patient, but PLAYER has a lot of quality.

88,"I’m absolutely delighted. I think the players' character, grit and determination were outstanding. It’s not unusual for us as we see it every day in training, but all of our decision making today at key moments was absolutely spot on.
They were so focused and determined to get the result. When we had opportunities to go forward, we were trying really hard to make something out of that, and when we had to defend, which we knew we would do quite a bit of, we were so diligent and organised. It was superb. I’m absolutely delighted for the players.
A result like today has been six months in the making. We’ve tried to build a philosophy and processes that we have wanted to try and get right. The belief in the players has been there from the start and what we are trying to do, they just needed to believe in it a little bit more.
I think the more that has happened, and having a fantastic transfer window, adding some more senior characters around the team, is really helping the team and that’s part of the growth we are trying to do. It has been coming and whether it be this one or something else, we have been working on this and I’m really pleased for everyone who is involved on and off the pitch who have done such a good job to get us to this point.
The fans were massively supportive today and towards the end of the game I thought they were outstanding and made sure we stayed on task and cheered us on. That makes a massive difference when you’re playing against teams like TEAM.
You have to accept you don’t have everything your own way but actually the calmness and composure of the team to just do all the bits that mattered I thought was superb and I’m so glad. It’s been a long time coming but to do it against TEAM is a massive plus. It’s important to keep building our fanbase as they’re a massive part of what we are trying to do, and we need more here, all the time.
PLAYER deserved it after putting in another really good shift for the team today and the two of them were just so committed to the team. They gave everything they possibly could.
This is huge. It’s a real good place to be and there’s a positive vibe within the team. They’ve got a bit of time now to relax and recover.",1.74,2,Strongly positive,5,2,2,0,2,2,2,0,10,04/02/2024,NA,13,sun,12:30 (13:30),2023/2024,rehanne skinner,2,west ham,116,west ham,116,arsenal,5,arsenal,5,chigwell construction,1,2,1,1.1,1.9,1.1-1.9,2,1,1,1.1,1.9,-0.8,1.8,1,0,0,4172,melissa burgin
80,"The best thing today is the result, and we're really pleased – but we can't be satisfied with the performance today. Especially the first-half was not good.
We were lucky that it was a draw at half-time and then it was a little bit louder than usual in the dressing room, and the players showed a good reaction. But still, I think we can do better.
In the second-half, we created some chances and in the first-half, to be honest, almost nothing, and then we looked a little bit… everything looked so slow.
But the players showed a good reaction, which shows again their great character, their great mentality, their great togetherness. And then we decided the game in the right moments, and now we go home, of course, being happy.
I wouldn't say it's impressive – it was better. We just did what we wanted to do in a better way.
We found our 10s in the pocket, but they also moved better. We knew when we find our players there, they drop with their defence and then we need runs in behind, like PLAYER in this situation.
I think in the first-half, we didn't even run in behind. We just always stopped and passing back and back and of course then you can't create chances or score goals. And this we did much better in the second half, but it's all about doing these runs, effort.
Also very good defending, great set play, good communication between PLAYER and PLAYER.
We have to be critical with us. We need a better performance than it was today.
Today also, to be fair, it was a little bit tricky because PLAYER had to go off after 15 minutes feeling sick and we knew PLAYER can't play 90 minutes after being out of training for two weeks.
But yes, we wanted a left foot there also who can switch the side, because we knew we had an overload on the opposite side. And we need PLAYER’s aggressivity, we need PLAYER’s passing, PLAYER’s one, two touches. It's great.
But after 60 minutes, PLAYER ran out of fuel. And so, yes, I think PLAYER did really well also for getting structure into our game. It’s good that all the players are back now.
Especially here in the league, set-plays are a big issue and we are talking about it. Also, we didn't train in the last two days because it was recovery, but we showed them many clips and what we want to do.
And I think now PLAYER had three, PLAYER has three, PLAYER has one, PLAYER has two. So, yes, we have many goals here. It helps us to win games.
It's unbelievable. We could see it was so foggy at the end, but our fans go everywhere: midweek, weekend, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday.
Thank you very much for this great support again. I mentioned it at the beginning of the season, it's so important to have a great togetherness in the club, but also with our fans, and this is what they show every game at home and away.
What we can do is [make sure] that they go back with a smile on their faces, and then showing the game and the result, and this is what the players did again.",1.266666667,2,Strongly positive,6,3,0,0.666666667,0.666666667,-1,0,-0.666666667,46,15/01/2025,NA,21,wed,19:30 (20:30),2024/2025,oliver glasner,8,crystal palace,36,leicester,58,crystal palace,36,leicester,58,king power,0,0,2,2.1,2.26,2.1-2.26,2,0,2,2.26,2.1,0.16,1.84,1,0,1,29766,andy madley
33,"It feels good and we're happy about the result.
This stadium is always difficult against a very good team. They have good players, a good coach and good ideas and fortunately we were able to overcome these difficulties.
We had to defend well to give us the platform.
We had to be together to overcome the bad moments. We did and were resilient to compete. We have to highlight this from the players in my opinion, that they are all together and this is one achievement from all of them, the team. The players on the pitch and the players on the bench, the players who didn't play, all of them are main actors.
We worked so hard for the result.
They had two clear chances in the first half, after they regained the ball in a very similar situation, and we tried to avoid that in the second half. 
We had two or three situations, clear, to score in the first half too, so in my opinion it was a balanced first half and in the second we were able to overcome the difficulties.
The commitment and focus of the players had to be highlighted.
Always it's a good moment to be able to celebrate with the fans.
We worked for this and the feeling is our energy, our petrol. This is why we are happy for the fans - we were unhappy that we were not able to offer them a victory in our last match, and the only thing we can do after is to work.
Despite losing, sometimes you have to keep a lot of things, and sometimes despite winning you have to improve other things. This is our work.
We are happy with every way we score.
Sometimes you have more spaces [on the pitch] and sometimes you don't. To make those moments, you have to overcome the other kind of moments in matches.
We are happy, I repeat, to overcome those moments.

It is tough to come here. We’ve seen TEAM struggle and TEAM drew here. It is not an easy place to come. It is to be expected if we are a bit tired. We are doing a lot travelling, we have had a lot of games, and a lot of away games this month.
People don’t realise how hard it is to do it again and again and again. It was the right performance considering all of those factors and it was nice for players to come on and make the difference.

118,"They don't really need me. When you are a TEAM player, you are a competitive player, you have a lot of ambitions. I'm trying to match my ambitions with their ambitions and make sure we're on the same page. It's also about making sure when we're in a game and are not leading that we stay strong mentally. That's really important and that is the confidence I try to bring to my players.
If something wrong or something bad happens in the game, that's fine, because we still have the talent and the quality to come back. We just have to stay strong individually and collectively to make sure we're all together to come back in the game.
When we analyse the game, we will see good things in the final third and in the box. We were able to be efficient, but I think we still have room for improvement in that area.
I spoke with PLAYER in the locker room and PLAYER's fine. When PLAYER jumped for the header, PLAYER just twisted PLAYER’s ankle when coming down. It doesn't look too bad, but we'll assess PLAYER and see how we move forward.
It's good for PLAYER’s confidence because she plays in a position where PLAYER sometimes doesn't get that much in the box.
When PLAYER has the opportunity to be in that position, PLAYER just has to take PLAYER’s chance and PLAYER did. PLAYER had a great shot. It was deflected a little bit, but it's a goal for PLAYER and good for the team also.
PLAYER is such a great player. PLAYER has a lot of talent. PLAYER's powerful and able to score many goals and in different ways.

25,"It was a very good performance, on the ball and off the ball, I think we competed quite well. We have been doing that since we started, sometimes better sometimes worse, but as I have said many times I think we are going in the right direction.
I said even after the TEAM game, no matter who the other team is it is important to play the way we want to play, on the ball and off the ball. When we do this and we get the result, for sure we are happy. But I think the performance was very good.
On the ball we played the way we prepared the game, because TEAM is a very difficult team. They are top defensively, it is very difficult to find space.
They don’t press, they just wait, so you have to be patient, if you force it you lose the ball and you concede. Off the ball we were very aggressive, we were pressing.
It was a very good game for many reasons. One of the reasons was because on the other side there was a team who is fantastic.
I consider MANAGER a top manager, MANAGER has won trophies everywhere and MANAGER is doing fantastic at TEAM. We were there, we prepared the game and we deserved the result.
I think we are not ready to compete with TEAM, TEAM and TEAM for many reasons. Because of today I am not going to change my idea, we are not ready for that. But the good thing is we are improving and hopefully very soon we can be there.
For sure we need to improve many things. We can attack better, we can defend better, but for me what we need is that you need to live moments to get better. You need to live moments to get better, and when we start to get those moments probably we get better and we can compete.

We’ve been working really hard in-house on that, and I thought the players did it well today.
I’m so delighted for both, PLAYER has been itching to score in training, so it was really positive for her to now take that next step.

A team away is never easy, it’s always going to be a tough game. I’m very happy with the players, all of them did fantastic because it was not an easy game.
We could have scored many goals, we also conceded some chances, but overall I think we deserved the result and I am very happy for the players.
It was a very good challenge for all aspects. They were pressing high, they were intense, but no matter what the opposition do it’s important that we are ready.
It’s important also to continue with that mentality, to try to win all the games. This is a good way to build something.

7,"I like to see this because if you only rely on one player when it comes to goals that is mostly not really helpful, although it's also nice to have one that scores a lot. But then to see that others score goals and threatening the other goal as well is pleasing to see. It's not only the one that scores the goal, I think the lead-up towards the goal is also very positive from our point of view.
The way I would like to see us play an away game. I think it's always, especially in the league, the defense come with a lot. There's a lot of fans in every stadium we play. The stadium is always sold out if TEAM comes. They don't need much to cheer for if TEAM comes in because if they already have an attack, or a corner kick, the fans are already cheering, so then you have to kill that momentum as much as you can and not give away anything. I think there was only two, three or four minutes where PLAYER lost the ball, PLAYER lost the ball and then we conceded a corner, which probably wasn't a corner, where the fans were a bit behind TEAM. For the rest, I think because we were so dominant we could manage TEAM but also the crowd.
I think the level you reach during the game always has to do with the team you face as well. TEAM has done really well before we faced them today. They were in a good mood but normally TEAM doesn't compete for winning the league. I think you have to always take this into account. If you look at how happy you are with a performance; away games are always difficult in the league. Especially here, I think last season it was 2-2, if I remember correctly. It's not an easy place to go to, so then to perform the way we did is pleasing to see.
Maybe we are a bit better, but it's not like we've increased enormously. What we did increase is scoring goals. There were games where we could've scored many more goals, but we didn't because we missed a few chances. The good thing is that in the last weeks when the opponent had a chance it was a goal [but] today they hit the bar and the post, so that is a positive to take.
It's normal in a season sometimes you miss chances and sometimes in a period of time the other team gets a chance and scores. Then sometimes they need two, three or four and don't score. That is what a season brings as well. It's good for us.
PLAYER and the word extraordinary is something I've heard a lot in the last six months. PLAYER truly deserves this and probably for the eight years, but I am involved in the last half-year. I don't think PLAYER keeps surprising us because we know what a player PLAYER is and we know PLAYER is able to do so. Apart from that, PLAYER works really hard for the team also when the other team has the ball. We can only hope PLAYER can keep bringing these performances in, but I would like to add that if PLAYER scores there's also a lead-up to PLAYER scoring. So there are also other players that bring PLAYER into these positions, but if you bring PLAYER in these positions, PLAYER is extraordinary. Definitely.
No, I don't think I used the previous game to this game. They played back then with different players, I think - they mostly played with their non-starters. We played that game also mostly with our non-starters if you look at the long term of players that played most. So, I don't think there's a comparison between these two games. The good thing for us is that we scored so many goals because that's what football is about - scoring goals and hoping the fans like what they see today.""",0.525,1,Mildly positive,4,6,0.333333333,0.444444444,1,0,0,-0.666666667,107,29/12/2024,NA,19,sun,17:15 (18:15),2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,west ham,117,liverpool,64,west ham,117,london,0,0,5,0.52,3.3,0.52-3.3,5,0,5,3.3,0.52,2.78,2.22,1,0,1,62476,anthony taylor
98,"I thought we performed fantastically. We were coming here to get the three points, and I thought the players performed fantastically from the first whistle. We created loads of opportunities, and I thought we played some great football in front of and behind their defensive line. The forward line did a great job, but defensively we were really resolute again.
I think it's a sign of things to come. Every game they're [the attack] just getting better and better with their relationships and working off of each other. And obviously, the bench is strong, so there are opportunities for change to add value.
But in particular, I think PLAYER coming off the front holds the ball up spectacularly well, and that then links us into other opportunities. I thought we gave their centre-halves a difficult day.
There definitely could have been more, that would be my only point. But that's being a manager and wanting more, right? But collectively, across the board, I thought everybody did a great job.
PLAYER, first start. PLAYER, first start. We're obviously trying to keep working on the quality of the squad, and we've had two players come in this window that have just been absolutely superb for us straight away. And PLAYER's so experienced and calm on the ball, so relaxed on the left foot, and I think it's just a sign of things to come. So I'm delighted for them both.
The players are so competitive. I think we did a great job [in the first half], but the first thing that the players were saying [at half-time] was, ‘we can do this, we can add that’. Collectively, we're wanting to be better all the time, and that's obviously really pleasing because we're all trying to be really diligent with the way that we play.
That, for me, is the culture of the team now. It just sums up how competitive we are and how much we want these points. I think they delivered exactly what they needed to in the second half. The substitutes came on and made a difference in the game and ensured that we saw the game out as well.
Our response to the previous match has been superb.
We won't be taking anything for granted [in the upcoming games]. It's important that we make sure that we keep our consistency levels the way they should be. There's everything to play for.
It's worth mentioning. We weren't happy with the last result, or the performance, but the response has been absolutely superb.

10,"First of all, credit to them the way they showed themselves here today. Of course, before the game starts you watch a few games of them and then you see, ‘Ah, they’re not afraid to press high, not afraid to play one-v-one.’ But then you always wonder, will they do this at STADIUM as well? But they definitely did. They were not afraid. Their playing style is also when the goalkeeper has the ball to play it long, so it is not that they stole this from the team we played last week, that’s just their style. They showed up in a very positive way. For us, it was all about the players that haven’t played that much yet, to give them playing time and give some playing time to a few youngsters.
Yeah, that is definitely true. But if a player is fit and doesn’t get the chance to show it, it’s also a frustration. The best part of being a footballer is playing, doing well and winning. If you don’t play because the manager makes a different decision or you’re not available, that is always difficult for every player because every player wants to do what they love most. Even I would love to play still but unfortunately that is not possible anymore.
I do think that is important, but that was not the reason to play PLAYER. The reason to play PLAYER was that PLAYER came back from a hamstring injury and two days ago PLAYER played PLAYER’s first minutes against TEAM. I think it’s a bit unknown for everyone how our flight was that night, so we couldn’t land here in CITY and we had to go to CITY. We came home really, really late and for me it was too big of a risk to play a player that had a hamstring issue five, six, seven, eight weeks ago two days after the TEAM game.
Then, the only available full-back is PLAYER and as a result of PLAYER playing I think it was good for PLAYER to play again in our own stadium, to feel the reception of the fans again. That was already fantastic when we played TEAM and also again special for PLAYER today. That will only help PLAYER and us because if you want to do special things during the season we have to do it together. Not only the players, not only the players with the manager, but definitely the players with the fans.
PLAYER is a striker, but if we are playing 11v11 and I make the choice to play PLAYER and the other side PLAYER is playing as a nine, PLAYER has to play as an 11 or as a six or whatever position we need. But PLAYER will always, like the other Academy players, give all they have. PLAYER is also a perfect example of that. If that is your mentality you can definitely get the most of your potential. That is what is going to happen with PLAYER. What that potential is, it probably needs some time to find out if PLAYER will in the end be a starter for us, but PLAYER will have a very good career because of PLAYER’s mentality. I am very sure of that.",-1.5,-2,Strongly negative,1,4,0.75,0.75,0.5,0,0,0.25,32,11/01/2025,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024/2025,arne slot,10,liverpool,64,liverpool,64,accrington stanley,1,accrington stanley,1,anfield,1,4,0,2.25,0.73,2.25-0.73,4,0,4,2.25,0.73,1.52,2.48,1,0,1,NA,NA

Yeah, it's two things. PLAYER has been away for a while, and obviously PLAYER's been back for a couple of weeks. But also for the team, we know set pieces are a big part of our game and football in general. So it was double happiness.
Yeah, it was good. You can feel them, you can hear them, you can see them.

58,"Very good. We talked about that, about playing with enthusiasm in this game, playing with the right attitude and commitment and they certainly showed that so I’m very happy.
PLAYER did it yesterday in training so we’re used to that. PLAYER’s a big talent, PLAYER’s got the right attitude, PLAYER’s got the right players and context around PLAYER and we need to make sure that we put brick by brick in the right order but we have some player here.
PLAYER’s going to really dictate how fast that’s going to go but I’m really happy with PLAYER.
So much personality there, PLAYER wants every ball, wants to make things happen. Outside and around PLAYER’s still a bit quiet as usual, very respectful, PLAYER‘s work ethic is tremendous and loves what PLAYER does, you can tell that.
That was planned. We have a lot of issues in the backline, we wanted to share the minutes because we lost PLAYER, we lost PLAYER as well on top of the other players so we have to make sure that we wanted to be competitive and we have to make sure as well that we protect players because we have a lot of games coming up now.
Certainly, PLAYER wouldn’t play tonight, PLAYER wouldn’t play three days ago against TEAM, PLAYER’s showing every day what PLAYER’s capable of and you see PLAYER’s teammates, they give PLAYER the ball all the time, that’s a great sign. We have some player there.
Very happy. I think it’s going to unlock that for PLAYER, looks really happy. PLAYER’s performing, that attitude is there always, but PLAYER need that feeling that PLAYER can put the ball in the back of the net.
It’s unbelievable but PLAYER does it in training almost every day, PLAYER’s got this quality, this personality, PLAYER’s there to make things happen, PLAYER doesn’t care who PLAYER’s got around, PLAYER needs to make the decision for themselves.",1.483333333,2,Strongly positive,6,5,1.64,0.432,1.88,2,2,-0.24,108,30/10/2024,NA,NA,NA,NA,2024/2025,mikel arteta,3,arsenal,6,preston north end,83,arsenal,6,preston north end,83,deepdale,0,0,3,NA,NA,NA,3,0,3,0,0,0,3,1,0,1,NA,NA

The biggest difference in these games is if you can make a big difference from the beginning of the game. But, sometimes you need to stay patient, you need to stay confident and trust yourself in that even if we don't score in the first opportunities then we can create more and score.
I'm pleased because I have depth in my squad and that's always important to make sure I rotate for them to stay confident.
When they come in and they are able to make an impact, that's good for them individually and their own confidence, but also for the team because it shows me now we'll have a bit of a headache in making some choices for the future.
Today was good because we could also rotate the squad. Most of the players deserve to play in this game. Sometimes it's difficult because I still have players who didn't play.

113,"It's always good. It's good for the team and brings confidence for some individuals.It makes it unpredictable for the opposition and this is also a good point for us. We were really patient, being able to move the ball really quickly, be sharp with one and two touches, being close to each other and finishing that action - that is also something I'm really proud of.
We made some tactical adjustments. Going on the second half, maybe in terms of fitness for TEAM it was harder to be consistent in the game. They left more space in their block and on the wide areas.
The good point from us is we were able to exploit them. This is a good thing because as a team, I always tell my players that it's really important to scan the spaces on the block and to be able to play where we have to play.
You can always ask for more. There is always room for improvements, especially from the first half.
I think we created some opportunities and good chances. When you are able to be clinical, it kills the game and this is the mentality we want to have.
I know my players were trying so hard, but it can be something mental and we need to make sure we help them with having the confidence.
Sometimes when you really want to score, you get nervous and it's trying to find the good balance between giving them some confidence and having them be able to relax so they can score.

Some kind words kept us going, and that response made a big difference.
Half-time was good and the messages we gave inside transferred well.
The second half was really impressive and the subs gave me plenty to think about, which is always a positive. It’s great to see players coming on with fresh ideas.
PLAYER’s delivery caused chaos. It was deadly.
PLAYER’s a brilliant crosser, and we know how dangerous PLAYER can be in those scenarios. PLAYER’s positioning and relentless pressure gave TEAM a tough time tonight.
We’ve spoken about maintaining professionalism. No one should know if we’ve won or lost just by looking at us.

95,"We’re delighted with the result tonight. We were really well worked. There were a lot of debuts tonight, young players on the pitch, and I think everybody's given such a good account of themselves. It’s what we wanted from the squad, to be able to make sure that they have an impact every time we play, and I think they've done a really good job tonight. It’s a confidence boost.
I don't think we've had as many chances as we would have maybe liked in some of the games that we've had prior to now, but today was a great opportunity to try and get them off and running, and the team capitalised on those opportunities.
There's been a lot of people contributing from an assist perspective as well. I think just the attitude and desire from all the players today was fantastic, and we could have had a couple more as well, and I think that's just a really good space to be in for the whole team.
The young players gave a really good account of themselves.
These are opportunities to make sure we utilise the whole squad. We talk all the time about everybody having an impact when you come on, making the most of whatever minutes you get and being able to have an impact in the game.
This was PLAYER first start for me, and PLAYER and PLAYER started the game, while PLAYER has come into the game as well in the later stages. Those young players have given a really good account of themselves today, and I think that's come from training with the first-team and learning and evolving. It's good to see them turning up and performing in a game like today and contributing to the team's performance.
It's important to build momentum ahead of our upcoming fixtures. 
I think it's great. We’ve had everyone on pitch over the course of these last three games, so that's really important, and I think it puts the squad in a good place, where you're actually able to see who's in good form and see who the best options are going into the game against TEAM at the weekend. 
Everybody knowing that they're contributing to the overall outcome of the team is a real positive. I'm delighted to have got them all on the pitch today, and I think everybody did a really good job.
The fans were fantastic tonight. I thought they were fantastic tonight, and everybody cheering was just great. We are just really pleased to be able to perform in front of our fans. Having two home games this week has been great, so obviously we wanted to try and put in a performance for them tonight, and I hope they enjoyed it.

78,"It was a difficult start to the game. We were too passive, we lost the ball too quickly, and then the pressure increased and increased, and we were punished.
But at the end of the first-half, we started to move the ball quicker, play more in their half and created some finishing opportunities and set-plays.
This kept alive the belief we could come back. And the second half was much better in the aggressivity, in the intensity, in and out of position, creating chances.
So, I was really pleased with the performance over 60 minutes today, and especially I'm pleased with the reaction after the difficult start.
If they are connected on the pitch, they always will create these situations, and this is what we have to work on, because sometimes the distances are too big between them and they can't play together.
It is not 100% settled but it is getting better and better, and especially if we do it, then they can see how we created this chance.
It shows that if everybody is doing their job, and I know it's not so easy against a fantastic squad of TEAM, but we could see that we are competitive against any team, and also we had great support from the stands.
So, thank you very much [to the fans]. Not just the players, everybody, I think, had to survive that first 30 minutes to believe in the team, and so all the fans had the feeling.

91,"The players were outstanding today and performed so well for big spells of the game against TEAM – both in and out of possession.
We have been working really hard on the way we start games...and managing the momentum a bit better because we have definitely had emotional responses to some parts of games that we need to manage better so we can stay making good decisions and looking after the ball.
I thought we managed the pressure out of possession really well and stayed disciplined and worked hard for each other.
Then, equally when we were in possession, I thought we caused a lot of problems for TEAM on counter-attacks and also created opportunities that pulled their backline out of shape. I am really proud of the players for that but really disappointed for them – because they worked so hard, and I felt that they deserved something more.
Players know [they were good chances] – they’re not trying to miss; everyone is trying to put the ball in the back of the net.
It comes down to a bit of composure and being a bit ruthless at times and we are working hard to fix that. We are trying to be more clinical as a team because chances are falling to a whole host of different people.
That is great that we are creating chances – and it is not easy to do that against TEAM – so the way we have played to create good opportunities is good – but we will get better at that because as players and staff, we will keep working [on being more clinical in front of goal.]
We have wanted to show the fans what we are about and make our home ground somewhere [fans] want to come to. We want them to [enjoy watching] the games and make it really difficult for everyone else. Obviously, the result is not what we wanted today – but we are trying to make this place a really difficult place to come to and we have done that again.
For the fans, for us, for the players, who are working incredibly hard, we can’t keep having the same conversation every week.
The obvious thing that people are going to talk about is PLAYER’s goal – which was disallowed. It is never offside in a million years. The frequency [of incorrect decisions] it is just poor.
I am always the first to say we had our chances.
I thought we managed to break down certain areas well against TEAM and we want to make the most of those chances. But at the same time, we can’t be having goals [incorrectly] disallowed that have such a big importance in the game.
There has been loads of change for PLAYER but PLAYER has been growing and growing in training and in games for us. PLAYER has had opportunities in games, but this one was the biggest one, and you are thrown in the deep end with this, and I thought PLAYER coped really well. PLAYER showed what PLAYER is capable of in the future, but you do just need to give players a bit of time to adjust, and I think PLAYER is moving in the right direction. I thought PLAYER did really well when we came on and we hope that PLAYER will continue that.
I thought we played some great football and moved the ball exceptionally well at times.
We want to put teams of the back foot when they come to this stadium, and they're loads of things we will reflect on positively from the game.

108,"I want to see my team to play so much better, but I think the most important thing to address today is the mentality. And that is the key for everything. So today we were a different team, not because of the system, not because of the technical aspect of the game, the tactical aspect of the game, we faced the competition in the way that we’re supposed to face every day - training and match. It doesn’t matter the place, the opponent, we need to face every day like that.
I am trying that every day, I am trying to push this team every day. Sometimes it is maybe not the best way, because I’m always challenging these players in everything I do, because I feel that we are - not just the players - but everybody in TEAM is too comfortable. So I think we need sometimes a shock. And you can see it today, we were a different team. It’s not about the system, it’s the way we face the competition.
Yeah, I think it’s a very good sign. It’s really clear. We lost three games in a row at home. Some of the games, we suffer two goals without doing nothing. So I’m upset today, really upset, because I’m pleased for the performance, but everybody today is going to say to that team that they did a good job, so today I’m allowed to be the only guy upset with the team. But today they were a team.
I don’t want to use that, but of course, when you train, you understand better the way we play, the positioning, the characteristics of the team-mate, those things are really important. But I don’t want to use that today. Today is all about the focus when you are playing football, the focus on set pieces, the focus on passing the ball, not in the sloppy way but in the way that we can not lose one ball because in the other part of the pitch is PLAYER, is PLAYER, so you don’t lose the ball. If you lose the ball in some parts of the pitch, you know you are going to suffer. If you have that mentality, you are a different team and I think that is clear.
I think I don’t want to talk about just PLAYER. PLAYER is the only player that I know really, really, really well. Everybody, even in the bench. So today, they faced the competition in a different way. It’s so simple but so difficult to explain here. So it’s so clear for everybody.
The end of the season is so long. But we had some good games during this last month. It’s something that we need to be really consistent. So if we have this talk after one… Against TEAM was the same. So we can talk but we need to show and to do it. And the best thing is right away tomorrow; tomorrow we have training and we have to maintain the same level of mentality.
No, I didn’t see the image. It seems like someone touched the ball before touching hand.
Focus on the performance. It was a shame because it’s really hard in the moment, when PLAYER touched the ball, you change the direction of the ball, was really hard for us. You could have snatched it, I think that is clear.
For me, I think it was the perfect decision, because PLAYER can shoot but PLAYER put the ball more in the centre for one PLAYER is running back. The ball I think was really slow for PLAYER, but sometimes you can not do it. But PLAYER made a good decision in my opinion.",-1.8,-2,Strongly negative,3,6,0.333333333,0.888888889,0.333333333,1,0,0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
109,"I think we play, especially in the first half, we play better [than] in the first game. We were better in set pieces today, more aggressive. We show different spirit, even with 10 players. We are improving on that aspect. I think we had a lot of difficulties in the beginning of the game to control the game with the ball and then we suffered, not big opportunities, but we suffered running after the ball, especially to switch of play. But then we can take in this moment, take the game to a different level when we talk about aggressivity. And that is a very good thing. With the [player] sent off [it] was really hard on us. And then we suffered all together, defending very well, with some opportunities from TEAM. The players were really tired, but I felt since the first minute that today was our day. And I felt also a connection with our fans, our staff. It was a very good day for us in that aspect. We need to improve the way we play football.
Yeah, it's far away. The players told me that it was not a penalty, but let's move on. We focus on the next game.
I think that is clear. I think also [it] is clear that when we play well early, that helps us to suffer. It's like more strain to suffer after if something happened. When the opponent has one opportunity, we can stop the game. We can count down the game, and I think we are understanding more the way we play football. Sometimes you are not playing well, but you can control the game in certain moments. But it's clear that we are improving in the way that we suffer playing football, and that is a good thing. It's not nice, but it's a good thing for our team.
Part of the idea then, like I said, with the ball we had some difficulties. I think players like PLAYER, who want to play open, playing inside, they need to suffer. I can put them open, but then I will have to change the idea and then it will take more time. I think it is also good for a player with the quality. For example, like PLAYER and PLAYER, if they are able to play inside and outside, they will be so much more complete. So, I think the idea still needs a lot of time, but in that part of the spirit to suffer, to understanding the game, to make some pauses. No, on the game, I think we are improving.
It was really important because [it] gives us more strength, and then with less one player, PLAYER's really hard to press. It's really hard to press a team like TEAM with 11 players, imagine with 10 players, and then you are in [a] disadvantage, [it] is really hard because they can control the ball. They were already controlling the ball in a lot of moments. So it was vital.
Yeah, it's really important, not just for PLAYER, but for all the players. Your life as a footballer has cycles, and moments, and sometimes in one week, your life can change. And you can see PLAYER - against TEAM, everybody was like pointing the finger for PLAYER, and I understand that. And today, PLAYER was our hero, also. PLAYER, [a] few weeks ago, had a small problem with our fans and today, every time PLAYER's going on the pitch, you feel the support from the fans. So, the life is like that and you have to continue [to be] humble, to work every day. Your time will come. And so it's really important for them. Not just for them, but for PLAYER’s teammates.
The set pieces is not my part, and today we were amazing in set pieces. So PLAYER was really good. PLAYER was really good. E PLAYER was really good, and they chose the right players. So, it's not my part, it was them. They did a very good job.
I don't know. I don't know, we'll see. PLAYER is a player for TEAM. We'll see. PLAYER has to work. PLAYER has to represent this club, and PLAYER loves this club, but I have to make choices. [I] already spoke about how I make the choices. So it is what it is. So let's continue. Let's see the next game. And like I said, I have to make a selection.",1.4,2,Strongly positive,1,8,0.6875,0.515625,1.0125,0,1,-0.325,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
