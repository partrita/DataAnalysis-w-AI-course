# My single prompt

```
This is my data and the codebook. Create a variable dictionary. Use the PDF I shared earlier. Output in markdown. For each variable: variable name, label, type, coverage (% missing), mean and mode. Round numbers. Look at cps for short labels. Provide a .md that I can download.
```
