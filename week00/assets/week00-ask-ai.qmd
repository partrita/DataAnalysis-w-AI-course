## Course design

# Prompt for Claude 4.0
(2025-06-01)

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
üîß **Is Week 00 a good name?**
  :::
  ::: {.card-body}

**G√°bor**:
"I am planning to add a new weekly material, I'll call it Week 00 for now. It is a preparatory session on coding for data analysis, so not all sorts of stuff, but data cleaning, analysis, some data science including ML, causal inference.

Can you help me design it? I have some ideas. It should:
* introduce ideas on how AI can help coding, in Python and R in particular
* why it works
* how to best write prompts to get good answers, which model to use on claude and chatgpt. Or what is the difference between models?
* give examples of use cases. 4 examples, 2-4 lines each.
* show available further tools like chatgpt, data analysis in project and canvas
* talk about other code related tools like cursor
* talk about github copilot
* discuss how to use github copilot in (a) vscode, (b) jupyter notebook, (c) Rstudio. Explain how to use it in workflow.

First version should be brief, outline. Will expand it gradually."

The current version is then very close to this.

## Naming

::: {.week-card .card}
::: {.card-header}
üîß **Is Week 00 a good name?**
  :::
  ::: {.card-body}

**G√°bor**:

"I am struggling with this decision. Should I add it as Week 00 or should I rename all weeks (01-->02, etc) and make this Week 01? What do you think?"**

**Claude:**

I'd recommend **sticking with Week 00** for several practical and pedagogical reasons.

## ‚úÖ **The Case for Week 00:**

**Practical Benefits:**
- **No Disruption:** Keeps all your existing numbering, assignments, and internal links intact.
- **Less Work:** Avoids the error-prone task of updating references throughout.
- **Flexibility:** Students with strong AI coding experience could potentially skim or skip.

**Pedagogical Rationale:**
- **Common Convention:** Week 00 is standard in CS courses for "setup" content.
- **Clear Signal:** "This is foundational prep, not optional."
- **Entry Point Flexibility:** Allows students to gauge their readiness.

## üéØ **Making Week 00 Feel Essential:**

**Course Description/Syllabus:**
- "Week 00 (Required): AI-Assisted Coding Foundations"
- "Essential preparation for all subsequent weeks"

**Week 01 Intro:**
- "This course assumes familiarity with AI coding tools covered in Week 00."
- Briefly recap/check if students have completed the prep.

**Cross-Referencing:**
- Link back to Week 00 skills throughout other weeks.
- "As covered in our Week 00 prompting strategies..."

## ‚öñÔ∏è **Alternative Considerations:**

The only reason to consider renumbering is if students consistently skip Week 00 and struggle. But this can be addressed by:
- Clear communication of its importance
- Quick competency check in Week 01
- Making Week 00 content a prerequisite for an assignment

**Recommendation:** Start with Week 00, see how it actually plays out, and renumber later if necessary. It's much easier to go 00‚Üí01 than to undo a full renumbering.

What's your gut feeling on student behavior? Will they skip something labeled "Week 00"?
