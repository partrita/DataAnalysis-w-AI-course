# My single prompt

```
This is my data and the codebook. Create a variable dictionary. Use the PDF I shared earlier. Output in markdown. For each variable: variable name, label, type, coverage (% missing), mean and mode. Round numbers. Look at cps for short labels. Provide a .md that I can download.

## Data Quality Notes

**Missing Data**: Unable to calculate exact coverage statistics without data access. Refer to original CPS documentation for universe definitions.

**Weights**: Use `weight` variable for population estimates. For earnings-related analysis, earnings weight `earnwt` is preferred.

**Time Period**: This extract contains data from the 2014 MORG files (Outgoing Rotation Groups only).

**Topcoding**: Earnings variables may be topcoded. Check for density spikes at maximum values.

## Key Variable Relationships

- **Labor Force Status** (`lfsr94`): Controls universe for many employment variables.
- **Education** (`grade92`): Uses post-1992 credential-based classification.
- **Earnings** (`earnwke`): Available for wage/salary workers only, excludes self-employed.
- **Hours Worked** (`uhours`): Usual hours at main job.
- **Demographics**: Standard CPS demographic variables with consistent coding.

## Usage Guidelines

1.  **Weights**: Always use appropriate weights for population estimates.
2.  **Missing Values**: Check codebook for universe definitions.
3.  **Time Series**: Be aware of classification changes over years.
4.  **Earnings**: Exclude self-employed for wage analysis.
5.  **Industry/Occupation**: Codes are based on 2002 NAICS and 2010 SOC systems.
