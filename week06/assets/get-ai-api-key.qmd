---

Below is a comprehensive, **step-by-step guide for you to obtain and securely store API keys** for both OpenAI **ChatGPT** and Anthropic **Claude**. It assumes you already have active accounts but need to know exactly where to navigate in each console to generate keys, fund your projects, and follow best practices for management. 

You'll need to spulrge a minimum of **$5** to get started. That's enough for the purpose of this course. 

## How to get an API key: OpenAI ChatGPT

1. **Log in to the OpenAI Platform**
   Go to [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and sign in with your ChatGPT credentials if prompted.

2. **Create a Project**
   Navigate to [https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/projects](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/projects) and click **+ Create**, enter a project name (e.g., "DA w AI Course"), then click **Create**.

3. **Set up Billing (Add Prepaid Credits)**
   In the left-hand menu under **Billing**, click **Add payment method**, enter your credit card details, then purchase the minimum \$5 to fund your project.

4. **Generate Your API Key**
   Within your project, go to the **API Keys** tab, click **+ Create new secret key**, give it a descriptive name (e.g., "Course Project Key"), and click **Create**. 

5. **Copy and Secure Your Key**
   The full secret key string will be displayed **only once**—**copy** it immediately and store it in a password manager or secure vault. You will not be able to view it again. 

### Best Practices

* Rotate keys every 90 days and revoke any that are no longer in use to limit exposure if compromised.
* Monitor your usage via the **Usage** dashboard at [https://platform.openai.com/account/usage](https://platform.openai.com/account/usage) or the **Usage** tab under Settings. 
* Never commit API keys to version control—add them to `.gitignore` or use secret-management tools

   The full API key string is shown **only once**—**copy** it immediately and store it in a secure vault. You will not be able to view it again.

5. **Set Up Billing or Claim Free Credits**

### Best Practices
