### Task

Create a pipeline similar to the one we used in class, but now aim to determine if the coach is a man or a woman. In this example dataset, men's teams have men coaches and women's teams have women coaches.

Pick a few texts and do it yourself.

Have the AI explain its decision.

### Deliverables:

* File with your AI-generated ratings: lastname_firstname_gender_text.xlsx.
* A short paragraph on why this may be easy or hard
lastname_firstname_gender_text.txt.
