title: "Reproduce FT graph"
---

Take a look at [this graph](/week01/assets/ft-liberation-day-usd-yield-2025-04-11.jpg) from the Financial Times. Your mission is to recreate this figure using real data.

### Option A (easier)

Use an AI assistant to find real data that matches or is very similar to the data used in the FT graph and use that data to recreate the same chart.

**Deliverables**

* Graph: A PDF version of your reproduced graph, named: "lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftfigure.pdf"
* Data: A CSV file containing the data used to create your graph, named: ("lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_ftdata.csv")

### Option B (more advanced)

Use an AI assistant to create an interactive app (dashboard) that mimics the FT graph.

* Minimum requirement: you should be able to set date and mouse over values
* Ideal: app updates data and graph dynamically
 * Can upload new data
 * Best: automation via API

### Grading

**Success criteria:**
- **Data accuracy:** Real government bond yield and tariff announcement data
- **Design fidelity:** Similar visual style, annotations, and layout
- **Code quality:** Reproducible workflow with clear documentation

 **Evaluation areas:**
- Problem-solving approach with AI assistance
- Quality of human oversight and iteration
- Documentation of AI use and limitations

**Deliverables**

* Link to app
* You can use tools like steamlit (Python), shinyapps (R), etc.
