title: "Research presentation after joining tables"
---

Form groups of 2-3 people using the same coding language.

### Task

Ask AI for a list of research questions that could be answered using many (min 4) of the provided hotel datasets. Iterate with AI to find interesting question(s), using personas.
* Write code to join the data you need.

**Option A (easier)**

* Write code to carry out your analysis (conditional comparison / simple regression).
* Create a single figure that shows your answer (or a simple version of your answer) to your research question (e.g. a scatterplot and a regression line, or a box plot, etc.).
Create a slideshow of min 6, max 10 pages to explain your research question, your merging process, your figure, and your conclusion.

For instance, you can use the following slideshow structure, with each bit being 1-2 slides:

* Research question and why you picked it / for whom
* Data and variables
* Detailed steps of joining tables to arrive at your working data (be specific here, include schema, keys used, type of join, 2-4 slides)
* Steps of creating variables for your analysis
* Results and interpretation
  
**Option B (more advanced)**

* In **addition to Option A's tasks**, pick another real life dataset that you can merge with the hotel data.
* Pick an additional question that you can answer using the hotel data and the newly merged dataset.
* Add two slides that include how you joined the two datasets and a figure showing your results.

### Deliverables:

* Slideshow (in pdf format): "lastname1_lastname2_lastname3_slides.pdf"
* Reproducible code "lastname1_lastname2_lastname3_code.pdf"
