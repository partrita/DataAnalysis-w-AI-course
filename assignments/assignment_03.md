## Assignment 3

Continue with the research question you had chosen in class. 

Use AI iteratively to create a report. 

### Tasks
**Option A (easy)**
  * Think in terms of two variables ($x$ and $y$). 
    * Pick a single variable or a combined index of variables
    * Pick a GDP variable
    * Think about a causal link. 
  * Create one carefully designed graph to illustrate the relationship (Graph 1)
  * At each step, explain your choices/decisions (ie why you chose a certain variable)
  * Create a Conclusion paragraph where you summarize your work and results in 80-100 words.
   
  
**Option B (advanced)**
* **In addition to the tasks in Option A**,  create another graph to show heterogeneity of country size groups using population (Graph 2)
* Run a regression and interpret the coefficient. 

### To submit
* Submission 1:  Submit a maximum 1-1.5 page report in .pdf format (including exhibits) (lastname_firstname_dawai_week03_report.pdf) (12p)
* Submission 2: Submit your code (or aprovide a link). (4p)
* Submission 3:
  What advice would you give to a fellow data analysis student on using AI to create a report? (lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_advice.txt) (4p)
    * List 2–3 pieces of advice based on your own experience using AI for this specific task.
    
**Important:** 
* Upload your report to the `student folder called Reports` at moodle
* Important: Do not use AI to help you generate the advice. We want to hear your personal examples and reflections, not AI-generated suggestions.
*  Next class in the first 20 mins each group will read another groups report and discuss the good and bad aspects of the report.
