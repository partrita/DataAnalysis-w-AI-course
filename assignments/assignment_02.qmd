title: "Assignment 2: Creating a readme doc"
---

### Task

In this assignment, you will create a readme document by asking for AI assistance.

* First, consider the VWS Survey we used in class: [Codebook](/data/VWS/codebook.pdf), [sample data](/data/WVS_random_subset500.csv)
* Second, choose a research question using the VWS data. It can be broad or specific. Ask AI for ideas.
* What variables would you use to investigate the research question? Pick the most relevant ones (min 8, max 25)
* Considering these variables **only** create a single README.md (in markdown). In the readme, include:

**Option A (easy)**

* key info on the dataset itself (you need to figure out what this key info is based on the lecture and examples)
* key variables description
* table with descriptive statistics for the 5 most important selected variables

**Option B (advanced)**

* **in addition** to the points in Option A, describe the folder structure you would use to work with this data


### To submit

* Submission 1: a finalized README.md file and code. (lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_readme.md) (16p)
* Submission 2:
  What advice would you give to a fellow data analysis student on **using AI to create README documents**? (lastname_firstname_dawai_week01_advice.txt) (4p)
    * List 2–3 pieces of advice based on your own experience using AI for this specific task.
  
**Important notice**

* Do not use AI to help you generate the advice. We want to hear your personal examples and reflections, not AI-generated suggestions.
