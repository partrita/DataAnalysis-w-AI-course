## Introduction

This course will provide students already familiar with core data analysis methods an experience of using AI tech to improve their productivity (*yes, this is a classic LLM sentence*). But yes, the idea is to help students who have studied data analysis / econometrics / quantitative methods to spend time thinking about **how to include AI in their analytical routine** and share experiences.

As AI is getting more and more powerful, it is also important to provide a platform to **discuss human agency in data analysis**. Thus, a key element of the course and the instructor is to lead discussions on the role of AI and humans in various aspects of data analysis.

**This is the Spring 2025 edition release.**

### For whom

This material is aimed at instructors of data science and analytics, who can guide the material, sharing experience and domain specific examples with students. All this is open source, and can be modified (see rights below).

But you, dear reader (student, practitioner, researcher, journalist, etc.) can also go it alone, checking out ideas and the lab sessions.

### AI and me

At the end of every class, instructor and students should always consider three questions:

1. How has AI **assisted** me in doing what I planned to do.
2. How has AI **failed** me: did it give half-truths, buggy code, inaccurate claims.
3. How has AI **extended** me: did it help me do things I could not have done, or gave me new ideas.


## Course description

### Content

The course focuses on using large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Anthropic Claude.ai, Mistral's Le Chat, and Google's Gemini to **carry out data analysis tasks**. We cover topics like data extraction and cleaning, data exploration and descriptive statistics, report writing, and turning text into data.

There are three **case studies** we use: (1) a set of simulated data tables on Austrian hotels, (2) the World Values Survey, and (3) a set of interview texts.

Course material includes weekly hands-on **assignments**. There is also a collection of learning material to look at [beyond core material](/learn-more/beyond.html), with blog, paper and video recommendations.

### Background knowledge: data analysis / econometrics

You need background in **data analysis / econometrics**, a good introductory course is sufficient. Of course, I suggest Chapters 1-12 and 19 of [Data Analysis for Business, Economics, and Policy (Cambridge UP, 2021)](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/getting-started). Full slideshows, data and code are open source. But consider buying the book!ü§ù

In particular, this course builds on [Chapters 1-6, and 7-10, 19 of Data Analysis](https://gabors-data-analysis.com/chapter-details/), but other intro econometrics + data science basics are fine.

### Background knowledge: coding

Students should have basic **coding knowledge** in Python or R (Stata is mostly fine, too).

### Relevance

AI is everywhere, it has become a must, and it will be used in most analytical jobs. It is like the internet used to be. It will not solve all problems, but pretty much all intellectual work will have input from AI.

### Learning Outcomes

Key outcomes. By the end of the course, students will be able to:

* Gain experience and confidence in using genAI for key tasks in data analysis.
* Build AI into their coding practice including data cleaning, description and reporting, and text analysis.
* Have an idea of use cases where AI assistance is (1) super useful, (2) helpful, or (3) currently problematic.
* Have an idea of use cases where AI assistance can be used as is, vs. where strong human oversight is needed.
* Have an understanding of resources for updates.

### Target audience

This course is for 3rd year (2nd year?) BA and MA students of any program with the prerequisite background. Economics, quantitative social science, political science, sociology, history. To be honest, all students should learn data analysis and get familiar with using AI.

But it can be used by anyone with appropriate background.

- **Week 03:** AI assisted report writing with WVS data
- **Week 04:** Joining multiple tables with Austrian hotel data
- **Week 05-06:** Analyzing text of football manager interviews
- **Week 07:** Dashboard development
- **Week 07:** AI as an applied econometric consultant

**Skill development path:**

- **Week 00:** Background prep: code writing with AI
- **Week 01-02:** Foundations (AI concepts, data exploration)
- **Week 03-04:** Core analysis (reporting, data cleaning)
- **Week 05-06:** Advanced applications (text analysis, APIs)
- **Week 05-06:** Research and presentation support

**Assignments**

Assignments are provided for every class.

Important note on assignments:
* Use AI, but do not submit what AI created -- AI is your assistant.
* One of the goals of this course is to practice this.

## Detailed Outline

### Week 00: AI for Coding

Using AI for code. This may be covered in coding classes already, so may not be covered in this class.

[Content](/week00)

### Week 01: LLM Review

What are LLMs and how does the magic happen. A non-technical brief introduction. How to work with LLMs? Also includes ideas for applications. Includes suggested readings, podcasts, and videos to watch.

[Content](/week01)

**Which AI?**

See [my take on current models](week01/assets/which-ai.html). As of *May 2025*.

### Week 02: Finding and Documenting Data and Code with AI

Learn how to write clear and professional code and data documentation. LLMs are a great help once you know the basics.

Case study: World Values Survey. Data is in [WVS](/data/VWS).

[Content](/week02)

### Week 03: Report Writing

Given data and a task, you need to write a short report. We compare different options of using LLMs, from one-shot prompts to iteration.

Case study: World Values Survey. Data is in [WVS](/data/VWS).

[Content](/week03)

### Week 04: Data Cleaning, Joining Tables

Joining data tables can be the most basic, yet rather complicated part of data cleaning.

Case study: Simulated Austrian hotels. Data is in [hotels](/data/austria-hotels).

[Content](/week04)

### Week 05: Text as Data 1 -- Intro lecture

No course of mine can escape football (soccer). Here we look at post-match interviews, learn the basics of text analysis and apply LLMs in what they do best: context dependent learning. This is a two-class series. The first one is an intro to natural language processing.

Case study: Football post-match interviews. Data is in [interviews](/data/interviews).

[Content](/week05)

### Week 06: Text as Data 2 -- Hands-on

Second class, now hands-on. How do LLMs compare to humans?

Case study: Football post-match interviews. Data is in [interviews](/data/interviews).

[Content](/week06)

### Week 07: Creating Simulations with Apps and Dashboards

## Thanks

**Thanks**: Mostly developed by [me, G√°bor B√©k√©s](https://sites.google.com/site/bekesg/). A million thanks to two wonderful human RAs: [Ms Zsuzsanna Vadle](https://bsky.app/profile/zsuzsannavadle.bsky.social) and [Mr Kenneth Colombe](https://bsky.app/profile/kcolombe24.bsky.social), both PhD students. Thanks to Claude.ai for great help in creating simulated datasets. ChatGPT and Claude.ai helped create slideshows and educated *me* on NLP. This is a beautiful example of collaborating with great young humans, while heavily benefiting from advanced AI.

Thanks for a teaching grant from CEU that allowed me to pay humans and AIs.

Thanks to [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) -- all this was drafted and written in Quarto by Posit and Rstudio.

## And now for this.

Using AI is very costly in terms of energy. Yes, it is getting cheaper. But humanity is also using it *a lot* more.
